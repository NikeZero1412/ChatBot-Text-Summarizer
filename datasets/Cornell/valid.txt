Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?	Well, there's someone I think might be --
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?	No
She okay?	I hope so.
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.	I don't have to be home 'til two.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.	Queen Harry?
Neat...	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.	Hi, Joey.
Where've you been?	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.	God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?	It's just you.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
You the new guy?	So they tell me...
How many people were in your old school?	Thirty-two.
That I'm used to.	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
He always have that shit-eating grin?	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
What makes you think he'll do it?	He seems like he thrives on danger
You got him involved?	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.	In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Assail your ears for one night.	It's her favorite band.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.	Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
What'd you do to her?	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Where ya goin?	Away.
Hey.	Are you lost?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.	We're not.
Who's that?	Patrick Verona   Random skid.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?	Does it matter?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.	Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?	Who?
Pick you up Friday, then	Oh, right.  Friday.
Why 're you doing this?	I told you
Why?	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
So what did I have an effect on ?	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.	Look up, sunshine
Put your right foot there --	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?	Something like that
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh
Why can't we agree on this?	Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right	So what I want doesn't matter?
Bianca did what?	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?	Just smack her now.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?	Yeah.  I guess.
So you got cozy with she who stings?	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?	Touch of the flu.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?	What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?	Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
What's a synonym for throbbing?	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap	Dr. Ruth?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.	Your life, and that of others!
I haven't given you much of a life.	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...	I find that hard to believe.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...	They tried... but I didn't let them.
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
What does he say?	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.	I'm not bargaining!
You defend yourself admirably...	... for a commoner?
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.	Look out of that window.
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?	He understands.
Why do you wish to sail west?	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.	Damn God!
I am listening, my son.	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
I believed in you...	Give me absolution.
New worlds create new people.	Oh?  So you are a new man?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
Do they have such thoughts?	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk...	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.	What about Oleg?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.	Give me another one, please.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Are you married?	Divorced.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.	So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?	Yes, I considered it.
I'll make some for us.	I'll get my clothes.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh.	It was my decision, not his.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?	'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.	But Chief?  Over this??
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.	Vodka tonic.
Sorry...PD only.	It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.	No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.	Nah, why should you?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.	Pretty.
Hmmmm.	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.	Of course.
Why not?	Something back home?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.	Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
So...who's Nicky?	What do you want?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.	What's your accomplishment.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.	If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?	I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Eddie, are you okay?	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.	I'm not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?	You're ruthless.
Okay.	See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.	Don't be late.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.	Jesus Christ.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.	I'm not moody.
Ready?	Keep them out of my way.
Are you married?	No.  Are you proposing?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.	What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.	Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.	You'll be my first.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?	Two weeks holiday.
Please join us.  Come on forward.	Is there a problem?
In here, says he wants a million.	Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.	Okay.
Get in the bathroom!	Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!	Cut!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.	Did you hurt her?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!	Milos.  Get my money!
Viewer discretion advised!	You want the tape?  There it is!
Isn't he a little moody?	Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Yeah?	Paulie, you've got kids, right?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!	This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
New York.	Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.	Excuse me?
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?	Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
You okay?	A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah?  What kind?	Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.	Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay. 	Okay, come on down.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.	I guess it isn't.
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
You probably also know that we found them okay.	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?	Yes, it is, Hal.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I am prepared to do that anyway.	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
CONTINUED	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED	Did they have any explanation for this?
When are you coming home?	In three days, darling, I hope.
Where is Mrs. Brown?	She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.	How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?	Yes, very pleasant.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?	Certainly.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
What do you mean?	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
That's true	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Name?	Hammond.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.	Great, just great.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.	Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Pay money?	Yeah, dummy.  Money.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.	Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Hey, what about me?	And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
I'm candy...	Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?	Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...	Here's hoping, baby...
Hello, again.	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
You lying son of a bitch...	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...	Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.	I'm helpin' you, huh?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Well?	It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
There.	Must be billy's girl.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
No class...	Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
What about Luther?	What about Ganz?
We missed.	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...	You sure that's the reason?
Yeah, I see her.	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Hey, how'd my car get here?	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Hey, there she is...	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.	Partnership?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Yeah...	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.	Jack?
What the bell happened?	I lost them, that's what happened.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?	I didn't have the time.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Bullshit red tape.	I'm heading out. How about you?
I don't think your gun's loaded...	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Hey, you're right.	You're hopeless.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.	I guess he got the message...
Thanks for the coffee.	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hey, I don't believe it.	Hiya, kid.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.	So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Three more hours...	Where is he?
We got a lot to talk about.	Yeah, old times.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Let her go.	First, the money.
You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.
How about some ammo?	It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Don't mess with me. How much?	Five bills.
Five.  On credit.	This ain't a credit business.
What're you laughing about?	Napoleon... small.
...We're saved!	I'm fucked!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!	So you do know her.
They all like this in your family, father?	She's an exception..
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..	What kind of mission?
What are we going to do?	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!	What is?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
They really made her...	Perfect.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...	They are... with me...
Hello?	Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!	It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
When EVIL returns so shall we.	We will be ready, Lord.
...Hello?	You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...	I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..	Thanks for reminding me..
I'm sorry..	This is a police control action..
Six to the left. One to the right.	He's on vacation.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?	Not without Leeloo.
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.	What mission?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?	Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
...Shit!	What is it?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.	Three of us will never fit in there!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.	Uh..you're welcome.
Which one?	All 900.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!	Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.	Apipoussan!
You get that off the screen?	Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..	OK, you can turn around!
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.	...The rain falls...
...Like love...	Exactly.
Tell me...	I love you...
The cash man!	Been here long?
It's not?	You gotta push the little yellow button...
This is all that survived?	Actually only one cell survived..
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.	It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
They just landed in the desert.	How much time is left?
Is that better?	Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.	There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Wait or act.	Recommendations.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.	Only too well... here you must be parched..
Drink!	To fame.. salud..
How's that? Can you hear me better now?	Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.	Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
How's our deal coming along?	Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!	...I can't wait to be among you.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?	Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I'm not accusing you...	Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...	What's wrong?  Are you alright?
What happened to you?	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...	I don't know what to say
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!	Amy...
Anything harder?	There's nothing harder.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.	What can I do for you today?
You said something about money.	Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Excellent.	Where are the women?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...	How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Alright, Tom.	What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I figured you share information.	We do.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.	Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Celebrity Films.	Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?	I know what you did.
What?	I know what you did.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...	Nobody saw you bring her in?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...	Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.	Show me where you buried her.
Do it.	Don't think I won't.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.	None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.	Shut your mouth and drive!
You almost went over your limit.	Fuck you.
Give me the film.	Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Big date tonight?	Yeah... guess so.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.	Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.	Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?	Max.
Not quite.	From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?	Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?	Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Where are your parents?	I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?	I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
What about me?	I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.	A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
You're learning.	Where does he sell it?
Wha... ?	Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."	"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?	Nope.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.	I try to be.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.	I'll do whatever I can to help.
Pittsburgh?	Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.	We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Nothing remotely like this.	I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.	You're joking.
Hello... ?	I'm here.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?	Yes, but...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...	Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?	No.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.	They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.	We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.	What?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.	It's been six years.
Hello... ?	Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Do you know what happened to her?	I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
No, sir, he is not.	He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Okay, I'll take it all.	Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?	What?
We'll figure it out.	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.	Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.	Who?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.	Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.	Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.	It was Freddy.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?	She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Something the matter with the cuisine?	Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.	You're not taking my baby!
Is that who you're waiting for?	No...
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?	Who said I...wait, what?
Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.
But how...?	He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
The tickets.	They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
How was the meeting?	Sobering...
Alice!	I've got to go.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.	But Dad --
Did everyone call everyone?	They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?	When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...	That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
You do good work, Alice.	So did Dan.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.	It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?	That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.	Two hours a day, six days a week.
It's okay.	Stick around, please?
You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.	It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'	Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...	We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -	But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -	Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Skipper - could you take a look here...?	Something wrong?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!	What????
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.	What about time...?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?	<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
All ready?	As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?	What?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.	That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.	Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.	Twombley involved?
Chub says you're fired.	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
I plan to. Soon.	How soon?
You see it?	Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?	Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.	You can't buy Wade off.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?	Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Mmm.	You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.	And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Double A. New Britain.	Oh.
This way.	Sun's gettin high.
No brag. Just fact.	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
No, I mean whereabouts.	A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Where'd you get the blood?	What blood?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.	Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.	Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Those are the Hoyts.	I don't care. They're out.
Why do they do that?	Do what?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.	No.
No what?	No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.	I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus, why?	I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".	Yes.
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
How about a Big Mac?	Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
What do you want, then?	Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Don't go playing policeman.	What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?	Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
On what you pay me?	Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.	You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Lillian!	Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --	Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
We should talk.	We've done all our talking, Wade.
See. Get your boots.	Hi honey.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?	Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...	I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.	You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Oh, Wade.	I've been thinking about it, that's all.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Going somewhere, Margie?	I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
You're not using it today?	It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.	How's that?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.	Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
The other guy.	Where... how'd you hear that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?	No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.	His office. You mean my old office.
You remember Margie Fogg?	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?	There was something. It happened up your way.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.	Huh?
The night before the shooting.	How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.	Who?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.	Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.	I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
What about Margie?	What about her?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?	I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.	You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.	We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.	Well, I never heard that one.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.	Wade, are you alright?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?	Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.	Some kids were teasing you?
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.	Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.	Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
It's cut.	cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.	You read my mind.
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
Uh, we got a problem here.	Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.	Lemme take a look.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
Why?	Because it is my duty.
The rest of the secret service?	Dead.
How many others killed?	Nine.
Who did this?	We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.	Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.	Copy, Air Force One.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.	Thank you.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Leave my daughter alone.	Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?	I know he left you behind.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.	That was war.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.	No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.	You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.	Over my dead body.
Stop.	You'll do it?
The fax machines.	Excuse me?
One.	But...
Yeah, right.	Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Thank you for calling the white House...	No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.	I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.	I might still have a few chips left.
You give me ulcers.	That's my job.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.	Sir...
Shut down accelerators.	Accelerators down.
Dunn.	Sir?
It's got to be stopped!	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?	Ask Simon.
Elaine.	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.	Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!
I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.	What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.	Ted, please be careful.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.	What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.	Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.	No, I've been excited before.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.	Simon, why has he become so... so...
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.	Don't be too long.
Can't we change course?	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
My career is shot.	Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
That's not possible.	Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?	Scraps.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.	How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
He's carrying a bomb.	A b...
Captain Oveur?	Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.	Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
You folks need any help?	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?	Yes.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.	I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Striker.	Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
No.  I mean your relationship.	We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.	Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.	Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?	I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?	Yes. Yes, of course.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.	I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.	But if you'll just give me...
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?	Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?	Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!	Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...	Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.	Thank you.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?	No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...	The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.	Would you go up, please?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.	Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.	The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I like my horizons narrow.	Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.	This is becoming a serious breach of security.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...	The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.	So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Who is he?	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Your health...	Ta ss'trakyona'...
I'm going home.	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
She's going to divorce me.	George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
How potent?	Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?	Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
But there's no more drug.	You understand that.  But how many others will?
How do I look?	You look very good.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--	The human?
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.	Yeah, I'll bet.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
What?	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Does that look at all suspicious to you?	Whatever gave you that idea?
Okay, let's do it.	Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.	Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Could it be intelligent?	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.	How long until it blows?
I'll go.	What?
Amy.	Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
What about you?  What's your interest in this?	Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?	Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
That the atmosphere processor?	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
You son of a bitch.	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.	But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?	We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.	It's insured.
What's he scanning for?	PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...	Sir?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.	Alive?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?	You tell me.  I only work here.
The corner!  Ready?	Do it!
Seventeen meters.	Let's get these things lit.
They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.
Now many?	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
It's game time.	Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Hicks, don't let him leave.	We ain't going anywhere.
Ellen.	Don't be long, Ellen.
Thanks.	Uh, what's next?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.	How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Fifteen meters.	I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
So what do I tell this guy?	Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
And how are we today?	Terrible.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?	No.. I've slept enough.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.	They're dead.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.	Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Burke!  Open the door!	Look!
I knew you'd come.	Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Can we dream?	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!	Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!	Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
What's that?	A brothel.
What?	Don't bother.
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.	I'm so relieved.
No! I won't have him back.	But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Why what, sir?	Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
I've come to dinnnnnner!	Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!	Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!	Em iram! Em iram!
No!	Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.	Ui-vol-i-tub!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!	Oh, leave me alone.
I don't know.	Well, ask her!
What?	Your father is dead.
You're not going to do this?	Why not? Half the house!
Why not?	You'd think I was mad.
Frau Mozart?	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
These are originals?	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?	What?
Why you?	I was at hand.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?	Leave him alone!
He's adorable!	Adorable!
Hey!	Hey!
A-flat, Majesty.	Ah-ha!
My pleasure.	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.	And the result satisfies.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.	Of course not.
Do you like this, Salieri?	It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?	Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?	Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?	Yes, Sire.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?	Well, yes, I admit it is.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.	Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Yes, sir.	Well. There it is.
Yes, what about him?	He's here.
Do you always live like this?	Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.	Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.	No one calls you that.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.	Good morning, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?	Yes, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.	Bene.
That's right.	My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Yes.	Can I see it?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.	Well, we can.
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.	Did you like it, then?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?	She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.	Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.	Whom did they choose?
Do you have a daughter?	I'm afraid not.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!	Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.	Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
You burned the score?	Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
With all my heart, Mozart.	Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.	I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
How long will you give me?	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.	Do you mean that?
What?	I'm too young to be so sick.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?	Yes.
Do you have me?	I think so.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?	I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.	What for?
So?	In the sight of God that is a sin.
Where?	Here in Vienna.
I can't say I do. What is it?	I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.	Ah - you've heard that?
No, you didn't!	I poisoned his life.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.	Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.	Italian?
He's setting that play to music?	Yes.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.	Incredible.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?	Yes, in the third act.
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
Can we come in?	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?	Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.	Has his friend appeared to him again?
Surely you're not suggesting...	David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.	Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Shall I send a car?	No, a cab will be faster.
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.	Will you come with me?
The bedroom.	There is only one bed.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?	Of course.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?	I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.	I wasn't hallucinating.
I've left those pills for you.	A doper werewolf.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.	No.
How are we feeling tonight?	No.
He all right?	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
All right, you two, move along.	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.	Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Who is this girl?	You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?	This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.	Oh, come on, tell us.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.	Alex?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.	Do you have bad dreams, too?
You're in a hospital in London.	London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.	The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
There were witnesses?	So they said.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.	Did you see Jack?
You're not having a good time are you?	Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?	I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.	We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
What about it?	It's a five-pointed star.
What the hell was that all about?	I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.	I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
You really scared me, you shithead.	Are you going to help me up?
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?	I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!	The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
It's you, David.	What?!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.	Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.	Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
You're not real.	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.	Yes.
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
What's that?	Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Oh.	But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I don't rightly know, sir.	That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
No kidding?	No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Where's Matt?	Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .	The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
About twenty-four thousand.	It was more than that last week.
Yeah.	Here's twenty-five thousand.
Let me have ten bucks?	Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Where you been?	Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.	Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.	Yes, sir.
What good will that do?	What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.	Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.	Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Thanks.	Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!	Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?	I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.	I haven't got it.
What do you mean?	All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?	You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .	Well, you can. You always could.
Why are you so anxious?	Don't you know?
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.	I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.	I'm listening.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?	Yes.
Yes, of course.	You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?	In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Longer.	I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!	Where is he now?
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.	Yes, sir.
You haven't got a uniform?	No, sir.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.	Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.	Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.	I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.	Mine too?
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.	What'll we do?
Yes, sir.	I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.	Is that busy husband of mine busy?
What did you do with it?	With what?
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.	Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.	I tell you, I saw them!
In Cluett's office?	Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?	Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
What did you find out, Mike?	I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Dude Finlay?	Yes, sir.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...	It couldn't have been earlier?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .	Then where were you?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!	Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.	What?
I ain't done --	WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."	Hey!
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.	Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Hands off your hip, Cole.	You're not scared, are you?
Thanks for the help.	After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.	So what do we do, General Lee?
The James-Younger Gang.	Sorry.
See, Frank's being smart about this.	Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
A bad idea.	I got us through the War all right.
Bob, rip up some bandages.	Pass me some whisky.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!	Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --	Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.	You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
What the --	Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...	Sadie was not a man!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --	Strategically.
Another dozen out back.	They gonna rush us?
What?	Where is Jesse James?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.	The District Marshall
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!	You're right, sir.
Fine. I'll just wait here.	I'd appreciate that.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.	I think he's already feeling better.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.	No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.	We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
"Big and older"?	You can shut up now.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.	Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.	Bob's upset.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.	I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.	Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.	They're making him a hero now.
Ma! Please!	Boys?
Teasing you is completely unfair.	What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?	Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Little ones.	Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
I am so sorry, Jesse.	Frank and me have to go away for a while.
I don't understand.	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...	She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
Don't turn around.	What?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.	I figured.
That's what I would have done.	I'm not hanged yet.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.	Thanks.
Really?	I hope I'm not being too forward.
Thank you, Miss -- ?	Lyla Devereux.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.	They had to be dealt with!
Really!	NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.	Yes sir.
Just perfect.	A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Parker.	Sir?
What is that?	What, sir?
That.	Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.	I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.	I can't believe this.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.	Pumpkin?
Yes?	Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
You like it there, don't you?	The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.	Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Pull out, goddamnit!	What do you want, Courtney?
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.	Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!	Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
What are you doing tonight?	Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.	You and...Luis?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?	I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.	Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.	Evelyn?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.	I don't want to talk about it.
Why? What's wrong?	My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
But what about the past? Our past?	We never really shared one.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.	Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Listen, what about dinner?	Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?	Yes, naturally.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?	But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Excuse me. I really must he going.	No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?	It's just not.
Patrick? Is that you?	No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?	Commes des Garcon.
Call me please, Patrick.	Jesus lives, Luis.
What...is...it?	Where are you going?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?	It looks that way, doesn't it?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.	But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.	Ask me a question.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.	Leaving what?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?	I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Late?	Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.	When?
I'll do it.	No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You don't like this, I take it?	Come on, you're prettier than that.
What is it?	Patrick?
Who?	Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Yes, Patrick?	Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Jean?	Yes, Patrick?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.	No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.	You didn't give them a name.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.	No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Interesting.	Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean? What?	Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Patrick Bateman's office.	Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?	Hello? Jean, I need help!
Just...say...no!	What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
A model? An actor?	No. Flattering, but no.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.	That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?	What?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?	No.
So, what's the topic of discussion?	I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.	So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?	No. I'm okay.
KIMBALL.	Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.	It's no problem
Where did you go to school?	Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.	Thanks.
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.
Yeah...Yale thing.	What do you mean...Yale thing?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?	He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.	I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?	No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?	Hang...out?
He had a yacht?	No, he just hung out there.
Don't you know this?	I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?	No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 	Eerie. Really eerie.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.	Oh really? I didn't know that.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...	Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?	Great, yes, I'd like that.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.	Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.	And?
I've questioned him.	Marcus?
He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
Listen, what's your name?	Al.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.	Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Hey, Halberstam?	Yes, Owen?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?	Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
You are a fanatic.	'Gonna wait outside.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.	"Make" him?
I'm just screwed.	You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
It's important.	If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.	But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.	I think that's great, Milo. I do.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --	Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
What!	Teddy was killed last night.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.	I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.	"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.	Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.	...Whaddo I do?
That was -- different.	...Different?
Milo?	Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.	You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What?	What'd they ever do for you?
What?!	Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your software?	Is it your dish?
That's gotta kill him, right?	Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.	We tried!
We could move 'em up here.	He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.	It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
You really wrote this just today?	What're you implying.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?	I'm sure.
You've been coming in early.	It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
You could've handwritten it.	I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Gary, I --	You see what's hanging on the wall?
This is good. Who did it?	'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Hasn't affected his work, though.	Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.	Gary, don't worry, we --
Ready for number three?	Let's go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --	You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
...You wanna work -- here?	Got out of my other commitment.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?	Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Every entry was authorized.	Keep looking.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.	Let's get him in here.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?	They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
Come with me.	Where we going?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!	I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.	I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?	...Something like that. Yeah.
What've you got there?	Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?	Then and now.  But not right now.
That's great. I -- didn't know.	She saved my life.
...Milo?	Hmm?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."	But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.	But they'd still get the idea, right?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.	Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.	You mean -- break in?
I don't know --	And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?	Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.	Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.	Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Please don't go.	At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Maybe it's the satellite.	Let's try #2.
...You got my E-mail?	And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Is that how Larry feels?	Uh. Not exactly.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.	What?!
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?	What d'you mean?
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.	If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.	Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.	Oh, and Austin...
Yes?	Be careful.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?	A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Carnies.	What?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?	Yes, Basil?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.	Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?	Well, you can't always get what you want.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.	Sure.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.	I'm sure.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?	Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.	Why?
Not a good time to lose one's head.	Indeed.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.	Shut up.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.	Likewise.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.	That's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.	I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Everything seems to be in order.	Hey, wait a minute--
Oh my God, he's back.	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?	Yes.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.	These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.	Dr. Evil?
Right.	They're mutated sea bass.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?	I don't want to.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
You didn't...	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.	Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --	Seriously?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.	There are limits?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...	... bottle ...
Knight ...	Black...
Nature ...	... preserve...
Hope...	... love ...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!	Sir August...?  What now?
May I help you, madam ...	Mr. John Steed, please.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...	We have met ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.	This isn't a game.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...	Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --	Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Who?	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...	Too many cooks --
Doctor Peel, I presume?	And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?	So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Much better.	And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...	Do you really think so?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...	An eccentric recluse?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.	June, July ... August?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?	Small talk.  Try the weather.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.	Did he say who?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...	Very good, Steed ...
Not quite. This is my field.	Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...	Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...	But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Three agents killed by bad weather...	... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Steed ... !	Mrs. Peel ... ?
Was I?	I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
And do you trust me?	I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
You're playing games.	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I'm playing to win.	Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...	... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'	'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.	I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Where's Mother?	Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.	Decontamination -- ?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.	I see.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.	Peter's brother?  But --
Privately owned by ...	Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
You're not venturing alone, surely.	I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.	Anyone particular in mind?
I was hoping you could tell me.	You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.	I feel sure of it.
John Steed.	Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?	Ugh ...
Look at that guy. What a hunk.	Check out the other guy's buns.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.	Women!
And...	Bond... James Bond.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?	Five thousand dollars.
I don't want any trouble.	Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.	Ooh, be still, my heart.
Great car.	The best.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.	So does Debbie.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?	Yes I did.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.	Yes, sir, I am.
Thanks for the advise, sir.	Keep me informed.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?	The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Cole?	Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, we've got to talk.	Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.	You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.	I'm going now, Cole.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?	It looks awful.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.	What's the matter?
That feels so great.	Good...
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.	You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...	Gonna get married...
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.	Your mother's not dead.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.	Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?	Yes...
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?	Ilene, Rick promised...
Are you sure this is a good idea?	Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Great bathing suit.	I think I screwed that one once.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?	What are you talking about, asshole?
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.	Gary, you're quite an animal.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?	Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.	Let's have a toast.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.	What's going on?
It's true.	This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.	Screw that.
What can I be doing for you?	You're a pimp?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.	Milt?
You want to share it?	Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?	What do you mean, it changes?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?	I couldn't find any razor blades.
You're all under arrest. Open up!	Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
I'd love that.	Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Where'd she go?	She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...	Olivier's in that, right?
I'm not really hungry.	C'mon. I insist.
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
What's this?	Got me.
You're late again, Rick.	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?	I don't know.
Oh these moments do try me...	Be gentle.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.	Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.	Let me take the lead, Stephen...
I like what you've done with the place.	It's comin' along... want a beer?
In the Field Museum once.	It works.
People actually used to pay you for this?	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.	Hey! You don't know me --
Thanks.	Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...	This?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.	Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
When dad died, I saw another fire...	Everybody did.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...	Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --	-- What are you doing here?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.	Uh huh.
Brian. What's wrong?	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --	-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --	-- I work for the city.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.	I quit two days ago, Brian.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?	Hey, do I know you?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?	Who's doing this?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?	What?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.	You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
-- Shhh.	What are you listening to?
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.	No it couldn't.
Read.	"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.	What reason?
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.	Yeah? Airtight?
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.
Did I say thanks?	No.
Four months?	I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.	Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.	I was ahead of my time.
Who's going to die?	Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.	And DIE!
Firehouse.	Cute.
Dad!	You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
We gotta roll, Stevie...	I'll be there.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...	Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
You can't talk about my brother like that...	Here we go...
Stephen, what are you doing here?	Fixing my roof.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?	He's going to be a fireman.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.	Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?	In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...	What's wrong?
Anyway, down here, take a look...	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.	What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Who's this?	He works for me.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.	They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.	She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.	I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
People.	You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...	Who?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.	Yes.
I forgive you.	Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?	I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!	That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --	Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
How's the case going?	What case?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?	Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.	B-L-A-K it is.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?	YEAH!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.	I didn't mean to scare you like that.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.	Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.	BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
You don't have the demographics.	So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
We're ready when you are.	Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.	You might be right.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.	No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Please, have a seat.	Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?	Look at my lips.
So that's what you been doing?	Damn skippy.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.	You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.	We might need some mo' money behind this.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.	Did we get our bill yet?
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?	Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?	We're starving.
You're now Mantan.	Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.	No costume.  No blackface.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?	Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.	I'm sorry I'm late.
Four minutes ago.	So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...	...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?	Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.	Go on.  Good so far.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?	I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.	Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.	And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?	In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!	We think so.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?	No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.	We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.	Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
That's what I'm askin'.	Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?	Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.	Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.	I didn't mean that, in life.
So he drank himself into a stuper?	The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?	I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Sounds risky to me.	You getting cold feet?
You okay?	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
Who's side are you on?	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
Is that good or bad?	It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?	To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Why'd you do that?	I don't want to hear it.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.	I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.	Light?
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Hi, Mona.	I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.	Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?	Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You feel good, not nervous?	I feel fine.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.	It looks delicious.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.	C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
How's the food?	Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.	If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Regardless, he still is your father.	It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?	What's a Negro.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.	Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.
Yes you!	This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
You sing and dance?	A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.	I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.	I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money and nothing else?	Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?	I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?	Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.	You tellin' the truth.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?	The one with da big...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?	Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...	...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...	...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
I heard ya lady is wild.	No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Around...	...too early...
...then what about...	...too late, maybe around...
...like macaroni and cheese...	...like grits and butter...
I slept too near where I fell out.	You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.	How be dat?
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.	Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
I feel a song a comin' on.	A song a comin' I feel.
What else?	Are you trying to rap to me?
Oh you do, huh?	Just a little something' somethin'.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.	No, before my time.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.	I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.	Y'know what?
What?	You look beautiful like that.
And?	And what?
Don't try to change to the subject.	Why don't you answer?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.	I never was more in earnest.
Where's the beauty you promised me?	It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.	How do you do, sir?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.	Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?	Only a very little, as soldiers do.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.	I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.	I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.	I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?	I will let down the steps for your honor.
Good gracious!  What is this?	You are going to drive to the frontier.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.	I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.	Your honor must lower his voice.
I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
For whom else have you worked?	No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.	I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?	Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?	Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.	Certain?
Never.	But, for a time... a passing fancy?
To make me wretched in two weeks.	To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
I feel the ribbon.	Then you must get it.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.	I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.	Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?	Yes!
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.	You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
May I be quite frank with you?	Yes, of course.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.	I see.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?	Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?	What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Yes, he's fine.	Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.	The milkmaid's daughter?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.	And he doesn't care about me?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.	Tender Hegenheim.
Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
Hurricane kept you up, too?	Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --	What do we do?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this...
Some.	Tell me about them.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --	I'm serious --
You shot Childs and Nunez.	They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.	And the bodies?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...	Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Back up.	Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Where's the cabin?	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Cadet, what's your name!	Sir, Dunbar, sir!
He wouldn't kill anybody...	Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.	Why?
Roberto, what the fuck?	We just want to check your pack --
Right?	Yeah...
Mueller.	Oh, come on --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --	Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --	From up close or far away?
I... I don't know...	What don't you know?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.	Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.	You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
He admitted it.	Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Why did he come back for you?	I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.	My heart weeps.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.	No. I said Dunbar.
Dunbar will testify that you were.	Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.	I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --	He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.	There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.	From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
They're taking your command, aren't they?	The Senator...
You're a good soldier, Bill.	I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.	That's preposterous --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --	You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Ah, Christ	You knew Sergeant West?
Is Dunbar cute?	That is the most unprofessional --
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.	Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.	Got it.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?	I don't think that has anything to do with --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --	You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --	Watch me.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.	You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --	Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Why do you care?	Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
I didn't shoot West...	What?
What?	What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
That's a fantastic idea --	See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
I pushed him too hard.	You couldn't have known --
For what?	That's gonna stay my secret.
We were close to something with Kendall.	Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Hardy, what are you doing --	Isn't this how your story goes?
We need to talk --	Seven.
This isn't the time --	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Do I have a choice in this?	Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Your phone number?	In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --	Poor fucker my ass...
We just want --	What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He said what?	"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.	Because he'd shot Mueller.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --	You can't threaten me --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.	I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Tell him to shut up --	-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?	Yeah.
So?	Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --	He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
You want Kendall, don't you?	He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Great, great. That's fantastic.	It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
See! The big guy likes it.	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?	Yes!
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
Well, she... uh...	Was she nekkid?
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.	Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Lord, I'm sorry I...	Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...	Go.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.	Stop.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.	Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.	What's your name, Giant?
You don't like it?	I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.	Okay.
What did she say?	Beats me.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...	Did you do any of that?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.	You think I'm up for it?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.	Really.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?	What did he say?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...	I will.
Why not religion, Dad?	It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.	Oh, so you know.
Dad!	What?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.	What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.	It would kill you, huh?
The river.	The river?
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
Let's get out of here.	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
I don't believe it!	I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
This is it? The whole vault.	'Fraid so.
Are you Jenny Hill?	I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.	We'll have to pick up a copy.
I talked with your father last night.	Did you?
You never told me how your parents met.	They met at Auburn.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.	That's because most of it never happened.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.	We rented a car.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.	Really! That's wonderful.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.	Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Mom?	Yes?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.	Do you want to stop?
Do you like it?	Yeah.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Yes. I know.	Good. 
And...	And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Right.	I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
What was that?	I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
You must have a visa or something...	You're asking for my documents?
She says she has a secret to tell.	What?
When?	"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
What was that?	Oh nothing.
Tell me.	No. It is too judgmental.
Do you believe in love?	I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.	Good night.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.	What? What does he want?
He wants a lot of money.	I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?	Yes.
Uh... Are you a giraffe?	Yes.
They go.	Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.	You don't understand anything.
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...	I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.	It's none of your business.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.	He will come back.
Shut up. I'm not listening.	You don't want to talk about it.
No.	Okay we won't talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.	Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes which?	Sometimes neither.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?	Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.	You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...	Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.	Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.	Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.	Thank Christ for that.
Have you had any before?	No.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?	No. I think I better just go.
You can probably buy them on the flight.	I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Whatever.	I'm sorry.
Why?	I'm not asking you to marry me.
My name's Sophia.	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
What are you doing?	Just wanted to see.
Lazarus?	Oh! Gave me a start.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.	You didn't have to do this.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.	Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.	That'd be nice.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.	At church?
Hey.	Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
What do you need?	I need ya help again.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?	Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.	Can I put it in your mouth?
Still need a lift?	Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?	Sure.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?	You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.	You need a ride?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...	That's not right, really, cuz I...
YOU SHUT UP!	Careful how you point that gun, boy.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.	Don't need none.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.	Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.	The fuck you been doin' to me?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?	Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.	The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!	Whose doin' is that?
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.	Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.	You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.	No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?	Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.	I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?	I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
I don't want you to let go.	Maybe I won't.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.	Word wit'cha. In private.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...	Now, hold up.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.	Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?	He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...	Or what?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?	I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?	I do.
Keep the change on that.	Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.	Why she got a chain on her?
You a preacher?	That's right.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.	What's on your mind?
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.	Rae don't do this now...
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.	You feelin' sick?
What?	Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
I feel better. Do you?	Yeah, I do.
Alright. How much you need, ho?	The hell you call me?
What's this?	Let go...
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.	Charlie...
What are they doing now?	Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.	Beats forty hours on a plane.
What'd you say?	Where is the subway station, please.
Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.	Hey, when in Rome --
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?	What does Charlie mean?
Where do we start looking for this guy?	Where would you look for the mafia?
Where're you going, Ichiro?	The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.	Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.	I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.	Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?	Yeah...
I've continued working on the case!	I can see that.
Know her?	We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'	No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Nick...	If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...	Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.	San is an honorable title.
I want to go talk to him.	What...?  Why?
It's very small.	Big enough.
Nick, you can't do this.	It's done.  You don't have to come.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.	Kampai.
Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.	Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I don't remember saying yes.	I don't remember you saying no.
Might be different in New York.	Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.	Then take it from him.
I want a gun.	It is not allowed.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.	Do you know what this is?
You had my help, detective.	If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?	I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.	Oh?
And what can he do for you?	Can the maker repair what he makes?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.	What about E.M.S. recombination?
But not to last.	Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.	Of course not.
You could help us.	I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
He could?	His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.	Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.	Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Six, huh?	Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
You got a machine on it yet?	We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.	Yeah.
It's gotta be right for my customer.	Your customer, eh?
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.	This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
You start.	The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
How do I stop one?	Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Not if it works.	And what in your estimation works?
Next.	Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
But I would like to buy you drink.	I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!	Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.	Prosit.
How long you had these guys?	Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?	I'm doing okay.
Let's hear it.	I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.	Meaning?
During the road test...	Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.	Huh huh.
But you haven't put in for emigration.	Nope.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.	Of course.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.	What night?
Yeah?	I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Are you for real?	Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
It's a good job.	You mean the snake.
The best.	Does it eat?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.	A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.	You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.	Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
I don't know... I think I missed something.	Like?
Uh-huh.	What's a long time?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?	Because it's not.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?	Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
You know what I think?	What?
Where the hell you been?	You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Bad?	Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
May I ask a personal question?	Go ahead.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?	One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?	Five, maybe six.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.	Don't move.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...	A tortoise.  What's that?
I'm hungry, J.F.	I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Methuselah Syndrome.	What's that?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?	What?!
Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?	Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
What's wrong with you?	I just had a mental picture of...
Right.	I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!	See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?	Heck, no!  What?!
Wait!  Wait!	What is it?!
It's Perry!	Perry?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.	Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
I think it's the eyes.	The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.	Hey, no kidding?  In color?
What's fair?	I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?	They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?	My Mom and Dad.
Thank you.	And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?	Okay.
Then forget it.	No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Because I want to get married.	Why?!
It does?	Sure.
I didn't know that.	Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
It didn't used to be that way.	I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Get out!	The engine is still running.
He has a computer?	Sure.
The guy with the underpants!	That's boring!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.	Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
No it's not!	Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!	Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
No!  Not crazy!	Do I look crazy?
I thought I was here to meet women.	Not that one!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.	Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.	Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
What?	Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--	I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
I'm leaving, too.	But, Eve, I would--
Eve?!	Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --	Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?	No.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?	Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.	...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!	My mother's like that.
I've got to go, now.	Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
These are wonderful.	It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!	Why?
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.	Shit is a French word?
But, I don't understand.	And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?	It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.	Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You have very nice ceilings.	I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.	Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.	He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.	My father is a genius.
How old are you?	Thirty-five.
The sky?  Where?	Up there!!
Help you?	Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!	You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Dad!	Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.	I'll go up.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.	Are you in trouble, son?!
No.	Yes.
Oh, my God!	He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.	Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.	What about relatives?
Good god.	Yeah.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?	The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?	"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!	Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Days??	Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Thirty -five years!	Then after that it's safe.
To go up.	To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?	No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.	All our friends...
You have tranquilizers?	I told you! I've got everything!
Oh, no.	What?
Hi, honey!	Hi.
Get the presents and do the lights.	You bet.
Yes, yes it is!	It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
We stay down here.	We do?
Yes.	Excuse me.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!	--do as I say!
How long will you set it for this time?	I thought ten years.
What are you bitching about now?	What are you doing here?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.	Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Stop it, you two!	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!	I knew you'd like him.
I don't know.	Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
You're serious, aren't you?	What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.	Well, that's blunt!
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?	No.
That water's freezing!	He's from Alaska.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!	Eve?!
Go to the bathroom.	Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!	Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.	You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
And if we can't find him?	We'll find him.
What's wrong?	I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!	Have him committed.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!	You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.	Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?	Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
To your health, Frank.	Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.	EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Jeffrey?	Yes?
Why do you do it?	I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
What color is it?	It's blue. Blue velvet.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?	I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.	We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.	Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.	Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.	Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want from me?	I, I don't know.
Do you like the way I feel?	Yes.
Yes.	Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
It used to make me laugh, but.	I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--	Frank is coming?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.	That's good.
What do you want to do?	I'm doing it.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?	Frank would open you.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?	Kiss me.
Do you love me?	Do you love me?
Dorothy. No!	If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Yes.	Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
They hurt his head.	Who, Dorothy?
Frank gone?	Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.	Oh he forced you, huh?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?	He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Hey? You like to walk.	What?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.	Be right down.
Thanks a lot, Mom.	Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.	Alright.
God, you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?	Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.	Yeah, I know.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.	Yeah. okay.
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.	Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Well.	I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!	Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Oh yeah?	You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.	Where are they?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?	I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.	Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?	Alright.
Are you alright?	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Yes. I do.	Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
You want a Dairy Queen?	No way. I'm about to blow up.
Wow. Should you tell my father?	I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.	Actually. I've been in twice.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.	I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, be careful.	Okay, Sandy.
Oh yeah?	Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?	Yeah.
You worry about me really?	Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Everything okay?	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Okay.	What is it?
What was that all about?	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?	No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Jeffrey? What's going on?	Shhh. I'll tell you.
Sandy?	Go ahead!
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.	No Jeffrey!!
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
Just for him?	Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up where?	Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.	Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.	What?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!	Where's your gun?
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?	Let's do him right here.
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.	Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
You think they sold me out? No way.	He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Anybody see ya?	Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
They got nothing.	This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 	You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Hello.	Connor, is that you?
Mother, is that you?	Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
How's Uncle Sibeal?	Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?	Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?	We... met them last night.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?	How many?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...	Shut it. It's Ma.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?	Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
Destroy all that which is evil...	...so that which is good may flourish
Know what we need, man?... some rope.	For what?
I don't know they just always need it.	What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Is that right, Rambo?	All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Oh, we're good man.	Yes, we are.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
Who did you kill?	Holy shit. Who? How many?
So what do you think?	I'm strangely comfortable with it.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?	A-fuckin'-men!
Now, you will receive us.	We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.	With every breath we shall hunt them down.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!	Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.	That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.	These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.	What?
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?	Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Who the...	Twist of lemon!
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?	Shit! Shit!
What are you serious?	Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Hello?	Hey, Murph.
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.	So?
You bet your ass he will.	Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.	We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
We'll keep going, Roc.	You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Has he now?	You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
You gonna do what I say, got it?	Yes.
Don't do this my son.	Open it!
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.	Fuck you Vincenzo.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.	I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
What color hair does he have?	Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?	Right. The blond guy.
What does Starsky say?	He says. This is he.
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!	Nothing. Go ahead.
Dignan, calm down.	You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Is that the manager?	Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
What about what that guy said?	Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?	Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.	Hi.
What the fuck is going on here?	What. What's the matter?
She's from Cuba.	No kidding.
He needs to hire an attorney.	No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.	This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.	After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
He's gone. He stole the car.	Where was it parked?
That coward. Son of a bitch.	Maybe he just went to the store.
He went back for his brother.	We said 48 hours.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --	Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --	I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I have an idea for that.	What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?	I don't think we can do that.
She doesn't need to know.	I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Our money situation is not good.	You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Sixteen dollars.	I know.
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.	Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --	Stand by, Bird Dog.
What's happening? What's going on?	It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Where's Kumar?	I don't know.
Come on.	I'll see you there.
Dignan, it's too late.	I don't think so.
How big is it?	Oh, I'd say about --
Where?	Behind Bob's house.
So how is it in there? 	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.	Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.	Thanks.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.	So do I.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?	Me?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.	Yeah.
See you.	See you, Bob.
You think he got my license plates?	He looked too shaken-up.
Anthony, I --	And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	No, I don't mind.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.	Sixty days?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.	Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Was Future Man adopted?	Jesus Christ! No.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?	Sure.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?	No.
Yeah.	Who's got the car keys?
It's in the driveway.	Temporarily.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.	Is that Buckethead?
You don't celebrate til it's over.	True.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.	I don't know about that.
I'm not allowed to drive those.	Not even for emergencies?
How much could you grow? Realistically.	As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.	You're paranoid, Bob.
The guy is fucking insane.	I warned you, Dignan.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.	Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I paid for it.	God DAMMIT.
How much is there?	Don't count it.
You really think he'll remember you?	No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"	That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.	It's registered in my mother's name.
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?	Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.	They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?	I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.	Don't threaten me, Bob.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.	Let's go.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?	This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't... 
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.	Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.	And the Landy woman?
Treadstone.	Never heard of it.
Let's talk about Conklin.	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...	...this is Conklin's computer.
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Sir...	Thanks.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.	What?
That's not what happened to your parents.	Then what?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.
You know I'm not.	YOU'RE A LIAR!
Front. Use your teeth.	Sorry. Old habits.
You still should've moved.	I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Try again.	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --	-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
It's just a nightmare.	I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
No... How?	The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.
Where --	Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Switch! You drive!	-- where? -
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.	What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.	There must be another way!
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
You hear me? I believed you.	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Why is she trying to kill me?	They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
A Russian?	It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
So when was I here?	What do you mean?
That's a lie!	You never worked Berlin...
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.	And the Germans can't match it?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- go -- take the van! --	-- the hotel -- how far? --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Alright... take it down.	What?
-- who? -- who else is here? --	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?	That's where we came out.
Still...	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?	I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Amnesia?	Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Are you an expert in amnesia?	Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?	I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?	You mean, did I want a date?
Some women like Dobermans --	What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.	And why is that?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...	Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.	Are we hacking or asking?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?	It was in Latin, sir.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.	So let the council swear publicly.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.	He has already agreed to come.
Longshanks promised!	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!	I have ordered conscriptions...
Now, my flower, do you understand?	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.	Wallace's followers.
The Bruce is not coming, William.	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
Wanna stay with me tonight?	I wanna have supper waitin'.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.	A common thief.
We must run in different directions!	We don't split up!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.	How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.	It's battle I want, not talk.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.	Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.	How soon?...
All the dads are gonna be there.	I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!	You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.	Great. I'll see you soon.
I don't know... I don't remember.	Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.	Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?	Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Why do you ask?	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...	What? What could he do?
I don't know. These things take time.	How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I found these. The others are still in storage.	Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.	Can you protect me?
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"	Straight up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.	Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Are you hurting her?	No, protecting her.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.	Photos?
Get out. Both of you.	Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?	He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?	You'll see.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...	I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
What's happened to you?	You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Because you're... different.	Different? How?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.	Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
I just thought you should know.	Know what?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?	Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I don't get it.	When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?	...yes.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.	Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...	I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.	Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?	Deal. Now read me something.
Can... can... Can I have this?	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
I couldn't cut the rope.	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.	Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Hey, what'd you do that for?	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What the hell are you doing?	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.	Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Lung cancer?	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Just get out, didja?	Huh?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?	Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Shut up, Tommy!	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --	-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Does he know that?	Oh, yes.
Nobody ever loved me that much.	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?	Oh, yes, please.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.	Thank you, but I hardly think --
Goodnight.	Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
But Sacha always puts out that light --	-- Tonight he forgot.
I'd better be going.	Er, my check, please.
You haven't heard my offer.	It's not for sale at any price.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.	No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.	Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?	It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.	I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.	Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Rick?	He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.	Good day.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.	And the other alternative?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."	How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.	He hasn't played it in a long time.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?	Looking for a job.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.	It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
I didn't count the days.	Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?	You can believe that if you want to.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.	No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.	I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?	It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Put them on the table.	No.
But Richard, no, I, I --	-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.	Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?	I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yes?	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Ask me?	Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Ilsa, I --	-- Yes?
No, Victor, there isn't.	I love you very much, my dear.
Good evening.	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.	There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?	I said, ask your wife.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?	We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
But we made a deal.	Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No, Captain, please.	No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
My bill.	No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.	I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.	Are you quite finished with us?
This is hardly the time or the place.	Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.	Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
For the time being.	Good day.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.	If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?	I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.	A leader, like Laszlo?
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.	But everybody's having such a good time.
I was misinformed.	Huh!
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.	It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Oh, no, Rick never --	-- Thanks. I will.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.	That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.	Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?	Put it down as a gesture to love.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?	I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.	What friend?
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.	Oh, he won't be followed here.
I have the letters right here.	Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.	Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.	You think of everything, don't you?
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.	Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.	Our expenses?
Uh huh.	Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Will I see you tonight?	I never make plans that far ahead.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --	-- Sacha, call a cab.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.	Take your hands off me!
Are my eyes really brown?	You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?	They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.	For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?	I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.	Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.	I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.	Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
No. Not me, boss.	Then don't have a drink.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.	No, I don't.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?	You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
It's bad.	Worse than Warsaw.
No more water, you said.	Take it.
Get water!	Fix raft first.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.	Why do they have to die for me?
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.	You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.	If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.	Thank you for fucking up my life.
It's real.	Nothing out there but ocean.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.	No.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.	Okay.  Sure.
No.  that was the last one.	Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?	You smell like formaldehyde.
Got to follow the paper path here.	Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Hey, look at you.	I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.	A ring.  I wanted a ring.
That's your dog.	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
When's the next Jumbo?	The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?	Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Need some help?	You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
You're Chuck Noland.	Yeah.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.	Let's eat.
Really?	Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.	It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.	There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
When'd you start working here?	Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?	We're on.
You're fucking dead!	I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.	I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!	Hallelujah.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.	Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!	It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
What'd she die of?	She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
What are you going to tell the little ones?	I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
It's time somebody ate *them*.	I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.
How many months are you?	Two.
Oh...	I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.	It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
A movie *outside*?	Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	"King Kong". It's really good.
But you looked as if you liked it.	I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
What's the *medical* explanation?	Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?	Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?	Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?	It will be okay.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.	No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Stop it! Just cut it out!	You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?	Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...	You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.	I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?	No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
So many children. Are they all orphans?	Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.	I know what you've been doing.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.	*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."	Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Is *your* father dead?	Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.	Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.	Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.	I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
What kind of plane are you flying?	A B-24 Liberator.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
No, I'm not. I need a job.	The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?	Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
I'm stayin', Homer.	Okay. Then you can be of use.
First pregnancy?	Yes, for both.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.	In other words, scurvy.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?	It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.	I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.	Of course.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I am not a doctor.	You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.	Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Rose Rose?	Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Shit. We don't know what he is.	Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.	Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.	You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Then it's malaria?	It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
*What* view?	Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
I told him that you all is sick.	Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!	You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!	I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.	Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.	Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.	They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.	We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.	The standard ten.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?	Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
So how'd you get caught?	Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.	Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.	You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.	I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.	We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.	So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.	And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
You'll be there?	Eight A.M. flight.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...	I'd like this cashed, please.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.	Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Minus one.	You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I guess it lacks a certain style.	Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?	Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.	Something stupid.
Sorry, I --	Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.	Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
That's not --	You interested in a little work?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.	Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Says who?	You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.	Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.	Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Mr. King, I think --	Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
You need to get a haircut.	What?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.	You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.	Then show me how.
Uh... Everything okay?	Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.	It's what I do. It's my job.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.	Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
He was looking out for you.	Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.	You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Everyone's working an angle, right?	There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about...	What about what?
Stop waving that thing around.	You sure we're clear?
It's bad luck.	Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Meet me at my place later.	How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.	Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
What do we do? We change the scam?	There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.	And we got rid of the red head.
King ain't gonna like this.	Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.	My fucking heart bleeds.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.	Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?	Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What happened?	Eee Oott Auught!
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.	I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
So what do you want?	I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.	A Fed? Is he close?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --	Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.	What do you get out of it?
You sell it.	To who?
I hate cheats.	All men are cheats.
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
I get it.	Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.	You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Are you trying to read my palm?	You've got such beautiful hands.
I loved it blond.	It's only hair. I haven't changed.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.	I'll see you in my dreams.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.	Do you have to swear all the time?
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.	Marion, stop this.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?	Marion. It's a book.
Without hope there's no point to anything.	Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
What?	You were talking in your sleep.
Nothing about you.	Then what?
Yes, I know that.	Don't let yourself down.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.	Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.	I don't gamble.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.	That's fine.
Which side do you like?	You choose.
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.	Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -	Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.	Robbery's not criminal?
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.	You're serious.
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute...
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
Hello...	Jack! It's Jani.
Jani! Where are you?	Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Ross.	Who did it? Tell me!
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.	Nice car.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.	You've done pretty well.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.	Some other time.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.	I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Does Bella come here?	That bitch? No.
What happened to Bella?	I'll tell you later.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.	Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?	Has he?
Why four? And not three or five?	It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.	Any exceptions?
How many aces are left?	Five.
I make it six.	Five.
You want me to check?	I said good call.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.	We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.	Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.	How?
Thanks for the information.	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.	What flickering light?
The key!	Key? Key? What is the key?
It didn't go off.	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.	Time to start talking.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?	Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.	Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?	All right, then...
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?	Energy shielding positive function.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?	No.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.	I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Well of course I exist.	But how do you know you exist?
Exactly.	Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.	Yes, well...
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.	I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.	Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...	...nine seconds...
Pinback...	Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.	Doolittle...
Yes.	I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.	Any planets?
What are you gonna name it?	What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?	Who cares. Don't bother me.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?	Out where?
TALBY!	Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Must get lonely being up here so much.	I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.	They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
What happened, Doolittle?	Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...	Yeah?
What's that, sir?	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Yes sir. Negative effect.	What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.	Sorry.
Commander? Are you still there?	Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.	No?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.	I'm on a break.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.	Yeah, sure, I understand.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Move it.	Where?
But I'm afraid of--	Don't look down.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.	Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.	I ain't mad at you...
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.	Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Damn... Are you alright?	They took my daughter.
What else can we do?	Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...	Hello...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--	I don't want to move away.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.	Are we in some kind of trouble?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.	When?
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?	Too early to tell.
So what are you gonna do about it?	Something.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.	You need to get out more.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.	How well do you remember the lab?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.	So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.	Somebody's got to.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.	I don't know what to say.
But she does work here?	She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.	Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.	How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.	You're also a fool.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...	Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Say the words, "I understand."	I understand.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?	They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
At least he didn't swing with your ride.	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Only one I can think of.	Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.	But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.	I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.	Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?	I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Make the call.	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Playing hooky again?	Feel like the dog's dinner.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.	What if he's on the level?
You left out condescending.	But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.	I'm the victim here.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.	Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.	Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?	You don't.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...	Easy Sketchy.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.	Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She was the one--	None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--	You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--	Shut-up...
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.	I was on call. 
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...	He's sick.
For a change.	How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.	Theo's dead.
Thanks, miss.	You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
No, I mean... you love your son?	More than anything in the world.
Whoa... she is a killer.	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...	You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
No problem.	Thanks.
We've got to take this slow...	Right, slow...
What was that D.J.'s name again?	Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Whoa... she just farted.	I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!	So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Now, how are we gonna do this?	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.	Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?	Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?	Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Dude, this is all I got.	Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?	What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.	Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?	Uhh... nothing.
But, mom!	Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.	If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Well? Continue! Continue!	Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.	Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.	You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!	Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Simplicity, Hawk.	Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.	Hello summer detention.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?	Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Look, you can have my wallet...	It's not nearly enough, punk.
Gimme your gun, boy!	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!	Not if I shoot first!
I did?	Yeah, you did!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!	Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.	So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.	So... that's it?
When can I squeeze one out?	Not until like... eighth grade.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?	You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Why did you make me flood the school?	We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Who is... we?	You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?	Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?	Take it off. I want to see you.
What happened to your eye?	I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?	It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?	I don't wanna talk about it.
Wanna walk me home?	Sure.
Wow. Did he go to jail?	He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.	Until it withers away.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?	Why?
What happened to your neck?	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.	Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's alright... I understand.	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
They suspended me for two days.	Are you okay?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What? How long was I asleep?	The whole movie. Let's go.
My mom is gone.	Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.	But you're OK?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.	It's safe here.
What?	There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Is that a cellar door?	Yeah...
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.	Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
People aren't that simple.	If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.	Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.	How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.	So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.	He said to follow him.
What else do you think about during school?	I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
What about your family, Donnie?	No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?	I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.	Have you ever made love, Donald?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?	I... I was playing with fire.
Regret.	What else makes you feel regret?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...	If God exists?
Where are we going, Donald?	I have the power to build a time machine.
No I don't.  She worries about you.	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.	I was just being honest.
Gerald.	Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?	Come again?
If that's what you think is necessary.	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.	If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?	How did you know --
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.	It is a big deal.
How did this happen?	I guess they made him do it.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.	But now you can't go.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!	This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Wicked.	No more fuckin' for her.
Where is she?!	She's right over there.
You're what?!	I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
So, what do I say?	Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...	Yeah, you betcha...
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!	Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!	Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.	Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Go on! Get out!	Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.	No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
What're you doin' here?	Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.	Bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.	Here, have some.
And the bite marks on my ears?	Yes...
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.	Yah-sure, fine... fine.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?	Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.	Oh, naw. Hi.
We was robbed.	Okay. Take her purse.
Annette, just use your hand.	They told me to practice.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.	It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Okay?	Mm-hm.
And the year before that?	"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?	"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.	This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.	Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?	Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."	A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --	Nothin' too showy!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.	You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
What!	We need more bars!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.	Harold!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.	English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.	What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?	"My dear"...
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --	I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Hey you!!	All right -
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.	Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.	Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.	I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.	What do I get?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?	I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
You no gotta no gun.	Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.	That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
So! -- He's on your side, too.	Sure.
How'm I doing, boss?	Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.	All right -- I'll go out and find one.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA	If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Are you sure you're not tired?	Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
That's what you think.	You swine!
Then it's war?	Yes.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?	I don't remember.
Oh, won't you reconsider...	Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...	Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?	Why -- why -- of course.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.	THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?	Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!	I didn't come here to be insulted.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.	This is terrible!
Uncle, you can't do this!	My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?	No, I think a whiskey.
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!	He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.	I intend to.
Now I think we really do understand one another.	Right... Right.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?	No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.	He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.	Do you think they'll go along with us?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.	Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
What is it, Treves?	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
I say Freddie, what are you about?	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?	You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
You never mentioned his mental state.	He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Good day...!	I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Alas, no.	Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.	I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Is he... dying then?	Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?	Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.	Good morning.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.	Yes.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?	...I learned a long time ago.
Yyess.	That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!	Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.	Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
My... name is...	John Merrick.
Merrick...	Say "Mmmerrick."
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?	Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.	Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
How long will I stay here?	I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Ohhh...	How is your tea, John?
The children! May I see?	Of course.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?	Your mother?
Good morning, John.	Good morning.
...my... home?	Yes, John.
Yes John?	Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
The workhouse.	Yes! The workhouse!
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?	Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Very smart indeed.	Yes. John wants it.
Well...	John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?	YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Pardon me?	Never mind. I'm the owner.
It's your fantasy...	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!	Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.	"The fifth one this week"!
No!	I'll bring it back.
But you don't realize....	Goodbye, Aud...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?	The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Really.	And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
I'll tell you what...	Yes?
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...	They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!	Don't talk nonsense.
Is there something the matter with it?	Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.	About raping me?
About NOT raping you...	You DON'T like it, do you?
You told them I raped you -- why?	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
It's Halfdan the Black!	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?	It saved my father!
I... I... KILLED her...	That's my boy!
I want to die...  No, I don't!	Row! Row! Row!
SHUT UP!	ROW!
It's magic.	What "magic"?
You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.	But you're the Gods!
You mean we'd be dead?	No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.	Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Row!	Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
I think we should go...	Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.	What's the matter with Bjorn?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 	What is it?
What are you talking about, Erik?	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...	Over the Edge of the World.
Bye, Leif.	Bye... sorry...
How did he do that?	Do what?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."	I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Are you all right?	No, I'm not.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.	How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?	That's it!
For your own sake... For the others... I...	Hang on...
Well! Come on!	I... I...
Who's that?	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What?	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.	What have you got there?
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
And something to sharpen them with?	Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.	She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Yeah.	Say hi to Naomi.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.	I did. You said, things were fine.
Yeah, you told me that later.	I told you that later.
I'm sorry.	Why?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.	No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.	Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I don't have one.	I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.	Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
You sure? That doesn't sound --	I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
My name's Clementine, by the way.	I'm Joel.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?	I'm not nuts.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?	Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
You like that?	Very much.
Well, I should probably get going.	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.	I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?	Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	Yes.
Tomorrow?	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Let me drive you home.	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
Oh, thank God. It's going.	It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
More?	No. Thanks.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?	No.
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.	Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
I had you pegged, didn't I?	You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.	I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You know what I did.	Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?	And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?	Yeah, like that.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.	I don't think I've slept in a year.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.	I think she's great.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...	Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
What if you stay this time?	I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Bye, Joel.	I love you.
When?	Tomorrow?
Listen, did you want to make love?	Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --	Oh, um...
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --	Hey, Joel --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.	Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.	What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
What took you so long?	I just walked in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.	I'm like a joke to them.
I should maybe talk to you.	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Clementine.	I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.	I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
What? What do you mean?	I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."	I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!	I hope you get your work done.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?	It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.	Oh! Great. That's great!
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.	We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.	Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Boo.	Hi.
Stan... c'mon...	Sorry. I just --
I know what it is.	Then why did you ask me?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.	They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Mary...	Yes?
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."	Is that Nietzsche?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.	It's no big deal.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.	Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
What, Howard?	We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
Stan? What's going on?	The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?	I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.	December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.	Yeah, probably a good idea.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.	Maybe after the holidays then.
It's an apartment.	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.	You can if you want.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.	Jesus, Patrick!
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.	Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?	It's a quote book.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --	Patrick, we're in the middle of --
What was that?	Clockworks.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.	The Clock People?
What do you believe in then?	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.	How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?	I'm staying with the Countess.
No, I guess not.	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.	What guy?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.	I have to go, Julian.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?	Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.	A born freak can only go uphill.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.	Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.	Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.	What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I can see why they sent you along.	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
...do you copy?	Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Holy shit...	Justin?
We have a man down...	Coop, where are you...
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.	What about the accumulator...?
I don't know what happened to Justin.	I'm telling you, I saw it...
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...	Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."	It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Do you hear it? Right there.	Hear what?
Please... kill...	Oh God...
What's happening...?	A power drain --
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...	His peritoneum has ruptured...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?	I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.	Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.	It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What does?	The dark inside me.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.	How do you know all this?
This is Weir.	Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
That means they didn't abandon ship.	So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Can anybody hear me...	Skipper...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.	Do it.
That's a negative, Starck.	Justin.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.	Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
I can see that, what're they for?	In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Any survivors?	Negative.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"	It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
If it worked.	If it worked, yes.
What about it?	The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.	Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.	You're insane. You've lost your mind.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.	Starck... Cooper...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...	That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?	Love to.
Captain Miller...	Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Sir.	Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Thank you.	Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?	She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.	Let's go.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?	I just finished drying...
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.	What's causing the readings?
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...	Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Who?	Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
Go ahead.	There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
Miller, come in...	What's going on in there, Starck?
What?	He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
I'm on my way, Starck.	You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!	Five seconds.
Weir can't be alive.	Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.	Blow it up?
First time in a grav couch?	Yes.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.	He's been past Mars?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 	Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
There's no one in the corridor but us.	Not according to the computer.
We have to do something, oh God...	Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...	She's not ugly.
What?	It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...	Picking up magnetic interference.
What happened to his eyes?	Explosive decompression.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.	Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.	I'm alright. Please.
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.	Is it safe?
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --	It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
Ben?	Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?	Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --	This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.	External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
The shields on the station should protect us.	Should?
How long was I out?	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.	Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.	Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Reed?... Sue?	They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --	Give me the god damn mirror!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.	I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Me like-y.	Stay right. Left is trouble.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!	Ben, are you there?
You need to control yourself and think before you --	Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?	Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You're really cramping my style here.	You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
You two need a time-out.	Blockhead started it!
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --	No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.	Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.	Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --	That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--	Never better.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
What?	We need to get past them.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...	I'm sure I can come up with something.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --	What in the world would give me that idea?
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?	Of course. Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.	With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Reed. How close are we to a cure?	No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --	You need a doctor.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.
Ben did this?	He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
But I'm not done with the machine --	Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Victor, your scar --	I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --	I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Reed's gonna fix me up --	For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.	I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.	Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Something happened to them, mon.	Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
On the ledge?	First door on your left!
I take out the garbage.	Don't strain yourself.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?	I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.	I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Are you still a virgin?	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Does Mom know you have company?	It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.	See you later.
Any problems?	No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?	They were left over from the last shift.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.	What a guy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?	Mark is a really nice boy...
Do you have any ice tea?	Sure. Come on in.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.	Let's continue.
Oh. Hi.	I didn't see you this morning.
Why don't you call me up tonight?	Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!	All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.	What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.	You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.	What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Yo.	Damone. It's Mark.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?	Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.	Fascinating.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.	You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.	Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.	He was hot, wasn't he?
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.	No way! He just called him a dick.
Was it great?	It was okay.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.	Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.	Not since November.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?	You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!	I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.	Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Another summer of working at Swenson's.	Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Sometime?	Yeah, like maybe never.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?	There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
You just ripped my card in two!	Yes.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!	Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?	Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?	Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Well, you'll find out next year.	No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
You look like you could still be in high school.	I know, everyone says that.
Thanks for picking me up.	No problem.
Where do you feel like going?	I don't know. Wherever you want.
It's very warm out tonight.	It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Do you know what you want?	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?	Not at all.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.	Two more Cokes.
Where's Mike today?	Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham?	John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.	You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...	Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Certainly, Mr. Duke!	My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...	WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!	Not where we operate.
What do you mean by that?	You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?	Hell, no!
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?	It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!	Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.	You whore!
That's good...	I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why?	Why what?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.	Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.	Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
What limes?	They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?	Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?	How about a check?
Jesus.	Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?	Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Lucy.	Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!	You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.	That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Like big lizards.	...and every one of them stacked naked...
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.	They were all veterans.
No, she's looking for you.	Me?
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.	It's gone too far.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...	Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.	Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?	How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?	I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!	Part of what?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.	No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Stop!	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!	They'll get in! We'll all die!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!	We can't risk letting them in.
We should go! We should go right now!	He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!	They'll be back.
We'll meet in three hours?	I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Where are you two going?	We're going to get my little girl.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.	Where is everyone?
I think I know where a CB is.	Where's that?
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.	Come on, come on.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.	And the rest of 'em?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.	Easy.
What tunnel? Where?	It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.	What!? I'm not going down there again!
You seem mighty collected about this.	Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Scared?	No. You?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.	The door... on three.
So, what now? Did those things leave?	Why don't you go check it out?
What now, Geronimo?	My truck.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.	What's in the back?
How are you holding up?	Well...
Oh, no.	It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.	But --
What? Really?	Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
He's dead.	What?
Open?	Covered.
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.	Whoa!
I wouldn't do that, son.	They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
Clever fuckers.	What the hell's going on here!?
Blow the goddamn hatch!	Clear!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.	Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?	There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.	Am I too heavy for you?
Well, maybe they migrate?	As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Hey!	Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Let's move.	I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
DON'T!	YOU'LL HIT US!
Let's wait it out.	They'll tear this place down within the hour.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.	And the last one is the...
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.	That's fine.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.	All right.
Did we make it?	I think --
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --	Thank you --
No, I'm concerned with everything.	But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Hi Frances, got a minute?	Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.	I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
You're afraid!	I'm not!
Madam...?	Thank you.
Okay, but come here first.	Huh.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?	In my eyes, officer.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?	Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Get your clothes on.	You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Without me.	Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?	Dick, we need some time apart --
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!	The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Were you a drug addict?	No. Never.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.	Thanks, Dad.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?	He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
I know that, Dad, but --	What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Are you... are you hungry?	I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.	I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
You're poisoning that child's mind.	I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.	Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Kurt!	Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Age?	Fifteen.
Only if you were in it. Are you?	I wouldn't miss it.
Why?	I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?	Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!	Yeah, well --
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.	Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.	Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.	Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
How ya doin', Farmer?	Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?	He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.	Forget it.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.	I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.	The hell you will, Harry York.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!	Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!	Frances...
Oh my God, I look awful.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Evening, gorgeous.	That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.	Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.	Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
To quarter-horses.	No. To thoroughbreds.
There's just one more thing.	What's that?
You give up on her?	Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Anyway... if you need me...	I got your number, Mister Man.
Frances! Frances!	Who?
Where to?	Oh Harry...
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.	Yeah. I don't know.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.	I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.	How did I look?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...	Why do you say that?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?	I'm not sure.
Pretty morning.	It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Shit!	Run!
...Is that not true?	Who's writing this guy's lines?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.	Fine!
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?	'Golden Boy.'
That's me, Clifford.	I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
I'm not!	Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
'But how do I know you love me?'	Your big speech?
You think I got it?	You got it.
Mama...	I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
What?	Go on...
I'll have lunch ready by one.	I'll be back.
Don't... talk crazy.	Mama...?
You're not going anywhere!	Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!	But what -- 
Yes...?	Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.	Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.	It ain't for lack of trying.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.	I see.
This whole thing is a joke!	Stay calm, please.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.	You're telling me you feel guilty.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.	Yeah?
And he drove me to mine.	Then why weep for him?
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.	Better that way... for me.
It can't be as bad as that.	Worse.
Friends? Do they live around here?	Yes. Very close
Come warm yourself if you like.	You speak.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.	How did you find me?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?	I see it before me.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
And if I consent?	We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
This was not taken from a grave.	What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's beautiful.	She's not for you.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.	So have I
I should go. I should leave today.	Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Are you all right?	Fine.
What does it say?	Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.	It's far too late for him to still be out.
Smell the air. Wonderful.	Quite a send-off, isn't it?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?	To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
You make me weak.	Not as weak as I.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.	They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.	Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Professor?	Oh God.
Now you've got him started.	These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.	But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Quite a place.	Thank you, Henry.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.	And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
I have always loved him.	Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.	You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.	You disdain accepted wisdom?
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.	But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.	The strain was evident.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.	Are you a physician?
Ah. An explorer.	Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Creature? A... human like creature?	You know of it?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?	Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Cabin B is ready.	Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?	You told her to sweep the courts.
You draw very well.	Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Next Friday.	Thanks, Alice.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.	Not if they're where I think they are.
Help you clean up?	Absolutely.
I don't hear it anymore.	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
What's the matter with it?	Wet. I don't know.
I wouldn't know.	Oh, you...
Somebody's there, Barry.	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...	I need you so much, Claudette.
What the hell?	Where'd you get that stuff?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.	Here we go.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...	Don't get up. Take a second...
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.	A short somewhere.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.	God, but I love that sexy talk.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?	Whatever you make yourself.
What hath God wrought?	That was the telephone.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.	Whassamatta?
Cowboy.	Girls can't be cowboys.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?	Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.	That's thirty percent.
What was that?	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.	Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
What about Kate?	They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.	If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Why did they block the door again?	To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?	He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.	Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.	What's this about, money?
My children are not going with you, and that's that.	That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Yes.	Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
How'd she die?	Auto wreck.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?	No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Died instantly?	Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Then?	Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.	Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Why not, against your religion?	No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
What are you going to do?	I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.	What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Did he...?	Yep.
I promise.	Scott?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?	Sure.
What?	Where are you taking us?
Mexico.	What's in Mexico?
What did I say?	You asked me if I would --
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?	Yes.
Watch my back!	Anytime.
See ya.	Later.
-- see this, television!	Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.	Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.	Knock yourself out.
What dya mean?	This is a private club. You're not welcome.
What the fuck was that about?	He signaled the Ranger.
Start the car.	You believe me don't cha?
Richie? You okay?	I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Do they have an X-rated channel?	No.
Is it me? Is it my fault?	It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Yes, Seth, I understand.	Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?	Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
I'm lookin' scared?	That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?	No, Richie, what do I look like?
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.	He needs our help!
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.	Who's "we"?
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --	Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.	Your prerogative, Senator.
No, sir, WHAT?	The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Then good night.	So I'll get a fair shot?
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."	Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?	I'm not sure what --
Shit.  Think we're had.	Smoke her.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!	Fuck me.
Yes?	Did you hear?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?	I was one member of the investigating commission.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.	That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.	My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Uh, question, ma'am.	Yes, dear.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --	Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?	What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?	I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.	I'm sure it is.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.	Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!	Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.	She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.	I oughtta report you.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?	What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Just a coincidence?	Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Chances of recovery?	You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.	Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?	Just like you would be.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.	I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.	Jordan.  You watch your ass.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.	What about him.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?	Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.	You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
I'd sure like to know who.	Yeah.  Me too.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.	And how do you know that?
Hey.  Way to gut it out.	Thanks, Wick.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?	Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.	That's a good story.
Do you, uh, know...	Sure, sure.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.	Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
Say again, sir?	You heard me.  Move on.
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --	Educate her, Pyro.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?	For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.	Should I be afraid?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?	I think you're the liar.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?	Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?	Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
I just wonder how that happened.	Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
You don't suppose this is just part of...	FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
This ain't workin' right!	What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.	Great. See ya then.
Where's Audrey?	In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
My God. He's going after the nest.	Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Animal, I can't.	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
What are you doing?	It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.	You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?	It's good to see you, Nick.
So you made it.	What?
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.	Most people don't.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?	I got pretty close.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Circuits are overloaded.	I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Who was that French guy, anyway.	Oh, just some insurance guy.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.	Speak of the devil.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.	He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Did Romeo have a name?	Nick Tatopoulos.
Your old sweetheart?	Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.	Five bucks.
I can't.	It's your choice.
You don't understand, I can get us information...	Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...	Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?	I don't think so.
They didn't make it.	Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
And how should we do that, Sir?	Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.	They are with me!
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.	We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Somebody must have seen it.	It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.	We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you looking for this?	Thanks.
We know.	Why are you telling this to me?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?	I am not permitted to speak of such things.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.	Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
What's with the chewing gum?	Makes us look more American.
Who the hell are you?	It's okay. I know her.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.	Well good, that's very... nice.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...	Is that the bathroom?
God, what an ass.	COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
About this much.	What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Go ahead!	You go first! There's no time!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...	No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
He's a twit!	Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
He wants to THINK!?	No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.	You have a better plan, Alex?
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...	Dear God.... How did I come to this?
May I get the check?	The ships are gaining...
Those blue things ate everybody here?	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."	No I didn't.
Hi Brandon.	No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Oh.  Okay.	You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
... Yes?	We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
How did you come to that conclusion?	My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
What?  Up?	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.	Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.	The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.	No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...	Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.	Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.	We're doing episode 31?
~e're alive!	We made it. Commander, we made it.'
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.	How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
It's Jason...	One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...	Only answers to me.
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.	Let me think. I need time to think.
Are they behind us?	No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?	Right.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?	Because it was on the show!
Tommy, look!  Those lights...	I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.	Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...	You have ten seconds.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!	Stop, please! I don't know!
Wait. What did you say?	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.	Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We.. We lie.	Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.	This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...	Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Commander?... Where are you... going?	Home.
Theramin.	Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?	Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-	I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
An interstellar vox.	Thanks
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.	It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
"Deception..." "Lies."	Well... Sort of...
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-	And determination.
What's going on?	I think we're going to exit the space port.
Excuse me?	They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.	Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!	It's as far as it goes!
Oh, right, sorry.	Okay, let's go.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.	It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.	Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal Tommy...	Pedal to the metal...
Find them.	But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?	Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Go on... I want to hear everything.	Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...	We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!	That can't be.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.	Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?	Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You, you just need a new flint, General.	You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
What?  What are you talking about?	That you would have known you can trust me.
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?	Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?	The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Who is that!?	That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.	To learn to shoot cannon?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.	Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Yessir.	Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
What's your advice, Alexander?	March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?	I'm not sure.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.	As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
They are... friends of Congress.	Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Let's not over do it...	I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Partially...	It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
A grand scheme?	A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.	To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!	Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?	Uh... none just now, but...
You must be very rich.	I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
These supplies...?	Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...	Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...	That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?	I think I heard that.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.	Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?	We're leaving them?
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.	You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.	Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.	Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?	That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.	I think I will disappoint you.
I say!	I see...
What is this?	An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.	Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.	They all sound big at the talking stage.
You see the paper?	I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?	Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?	Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
You get the money?	No. What's this?
You gave him the money?	I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?	Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
What's this movie you're doing first?	Harry, let me answer that.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.	It's what he said, I'm his associate.
There's Ilona.	What about her?
You know how to write one of these?	There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.	Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.	Gimme an hour.
Where's Karen?	In the can. That the money?
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".	I can't do it.
I'm working on a few things.	Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
I don't know.	It's not the kind of thing you do.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.	Okay. So who are you?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.	Never heard of him.
What?	Look at me, Ray.
Who the fuck are you?	Ray Barboni. From Miami.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?	I'm in the movie business.
I'm looking at you.	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.	You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
I want you to.	You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.	Fuckin' basketball game.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.	They always paid.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.	Who's the star?
You don't even know these guys.	Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.	They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'	You're kidding, right?
What?	I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.	His shrink's trainer.
Really.	Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.	I found him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.	Who?
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.	Ask your man here.
I'm thinking of a movie.	One of mine?
One we're producing.	With what? Wiseguy money?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.	Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?	It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?	At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.	I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.	I know what a vig is.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.	...That's what we finally decided.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?	I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.	He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.	Don't go out of your way.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?	How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?	Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Harry... My God...	What happened?
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.	You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?	I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.	I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, but whose point of view?	Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
I miss Murray, Harry.	Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?	No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.	Harry -–
How did you get in the house?	He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.	That's where you got the idea?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?	Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.	No problem. You go on off to bed.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.	Shylock?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...	Hello, Martin.
Lufkin. His... agent.	Yeah, Karen knows him.
North Island, please repeat? Over.	Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.	Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Fucker!	Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.	Morning, skipper.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.	She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
The turbine blew.	Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?	Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Maybe that is his boat.	Gimme a break.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?	Why not?
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.	Sounds reasonable.
How long, then?	I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?	A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.	It looks like it.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.	What is it?
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.	With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!	You smashed it!
What the fuck -- ?	You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?	Conveniently enough for you.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.	Right.
Morning everybody.	Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.	He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Stay away. Or else.	Because of the gold.
What?	Nothing. Let's get outa here.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.	They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.	Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Who?	The guy. He just came this way.
What? What the hell're you talking about.	I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.	Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Smashed it up pretty bad.	But, who -- ?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.	But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.	If it was a ship she hit.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.	Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.	Hey.
The what?	Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
What happened.	Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.	Victims of what?
Murphy to Epps.	Epps, over.
Nope.	He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Epps? You there?	Right here.
Over the gold.	Maybe it was more than that.
They went crazy.	Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Greer to Murphy.	Go.
Yeah.	There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.	So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.	And look what happened.
It's a Noaa buoy.	A what?
He took the shotgun and a light.	Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
What about the gold?	Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.	You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.	Fine with me.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
No, no. You got leak.	You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
That cost me twenty grand at least.	Fifteen, at the most.
Have you seen my blue spatula?	Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?	It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Guess.	How should I know?
Someone from the past.	Who?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.	She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!	But I can't --
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!	Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...	Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...	I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.	Help me what?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!	But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!	Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.	Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!	No.
Hi... what's up?	Can I come in?
What do you mean "why"?	Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Nothing.	Then why do you hate me so much?
Oh, hi...	Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
God, what a bunch of retards...	I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!	What?
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!	Why?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?	How perfect.
Why?	Just look at them!
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.	I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?	God, it's so totally pathetic.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"	God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.	We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.	I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Look, maybe that's him!	It's still twenty-five minutes early.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?	What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
What's going on now? What's he doing?	Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
What's he doing now?	He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
He's insane!	We should follow him home.
Ew, look at this...	Gross!
Not really...	Forget it, I can't explain it...
"Funky"?	What, is she black now?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.	You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Where are we going?	Let's go hassle Josh.
What was that all about?	It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.	Everybody's too stupid!
How about this one?	Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Ew ... when did you get that?	This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
You won't believe it! Guess!	Where?
God, how can you stand all these assholes?	I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...	He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.	Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're gross.  See that guy?	Which one?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?	...maybe we should be lesbos...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?	Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.	We were such desperate sluts back then.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!	I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!	Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...	I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...	No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Don't you want nice stuff?	I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...	What are you talking about? Who?
When was this?	I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!	Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!	You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.	Well, we won't keep you.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!	Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.	That's okay...
Do you have any other old records besides these?	Seymour does.
You still interested in that?	I thought it wasn't for sale.
Punk rock is over!	I know it's over, asshole, I --
Oh, how "punk."	That tape sucked, by the way!
...are you waiting for a bus?	Yes.
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.	You're late, asshole.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.	Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.	What?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.	I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?	Sure, I guess.
Is this one any good?	Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?	The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Yeah, sure, I guess...	Watch my stuff.
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?	I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Really? Can I see it?	Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!	Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!	Oh, right...
What about her? Would you go out with her?	I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Wow! Look at all these creeps!	Shh!
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.	C'mon, Seymour, please?
Relax, Seymour, relax...	That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
It's not hopeless...	Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...	But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --	It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Wow, this is so cool...	If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?	What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...	You work at Cook's Chicken?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.	Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?	No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...	That's the spirit!
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...	Oh yeah?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?	Who knows?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!	How can you be so sure?
Well when can we do something?	It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...	I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
What's up?	Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.	Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --	FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.	What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.	Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...	But, I...
Please Josh?	Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?	He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I agree.	I wish I could see him.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?	It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?	I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!	Right, exactly!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.	Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.	He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
Morning, friend, glorious day.	As are they all.
You've never built in Africa.	But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.	Don't they, though?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?	Yes he is.
And it worked?	In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.	All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?	Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-	-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?	I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.	We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.	What if there are complications?-
Don't much like them.	The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Anything special about them?	Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.	Have you got that in writing? 
Finish your tour?	And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?	We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
Got me out of trouble.	Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Have you got it?	No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
...misfire... it jammed...	Has it ever done that before?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?	Don't they have to be?...
How many do you think they've killed?	The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
The workers don't get on?	Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
For you.	Thank you, Samuel.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?	I don't believe you had a mother. 
How many cattle?	Four should do it.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Janosz?	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.	We don't have a relationship.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.	Does he ever mention me?
That's where the buggy stopped.	Okay, let's take a look.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
You're really good, you know.	I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?	I don't know what to do anymore.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?	I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?	I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I'm not even good for me.	Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.	Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?	Now you're talking.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.	I know.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --	Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --	-- the sorrow --
Your honor, may I approach the bench?	Yes.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.	Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?	No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
I'd like to have a stool specimen	Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
So far so good.	I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Nothing.  Not a trace.	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
I'm Egon --	And we're the ...
Six feet -- seven -- eight --	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.	You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
Rivers of the stuff!	And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.	There's something very familiar about this painting.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Who?  Who?  Who?	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.	Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Ray --	I'm Peter --
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.	I'll get one more reading.
What happened?	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought --
Are you all right?	Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.	Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.	You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Aren't you glad we waited?	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?	No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.	I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Are you the Gatekeeper?	I am Zuul.
Like a used car salesman.	Thanks.  What's in there?
That's too bad.	What?
Uh-huh.	Well, let's check it out.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Who's the stiff?	The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Can't you tell me now?	I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
All right.  Since you put it that way.	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
He is the Destructor.	Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Do you want this body?	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.	I am Zuul.  I am ...
But why?  The students love us!	Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.	Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.	I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.	What calls?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.	Here are tonight's calls.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.	The EPA?  What's he want?
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?	You could say that.
All right.  What is it?	A square?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Yes?	Were you recently in the bathroom?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?	I'm always serious.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?	She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Did you see anything?	Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.	If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.	She said he was "the Destructor."
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.	And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
I told you it's real.	What do we do now?
Anything!  Just make contact.	Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.	Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.	But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
How was your date?	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.	So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Agile bastard, isn't he?	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?	The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?	Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?	And the seas would boil ...
I should at least have you, don't you think?	If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?	I'm sure, I don't know.
For the gods, spit it out!	Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Where have you been?	Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.	Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Then you'd be out of a job.	Gladly Caesar.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.	We have to stop the Germans now!
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.	I'll nose around...
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...	That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.	That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.	I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.	You don't know how wrong you are.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.	Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?	I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.	Yours will do!
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.	Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.	The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.	I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.	So I understand.
The Senators admire you.	They fear me.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.	I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.	Well, we can try...
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.	I can't let you do that.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...	The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
He's very realistic.	Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.	Greeks?
You need to come home!	I can see that...
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?	Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?	We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.	No!
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?	You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Take your hands off me animal!	Chain him.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!	So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!	As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?	On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...	I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.	I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.	Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
You're living at home now. Is that right?	Yes.
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.	But, Elaine --
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?	No, I couldn't.
We won't. Let's go inside.	Wait a minute.
Where we going?	I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.	Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Benjamin --	Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
What's the matter?	You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Don't cry. 	Get out of here.
Where are you meeting this person?	At the Zoo.
Yes.	Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
I don't understand --	Did you say rape her?
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?	Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
What are you looking for?	My belt.
What are you going to do now?	I don't know.
Are you going home?	No.
You won't?	I don't know.
Is that so? You might marry me?	Yes.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?	I'll think about it.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.	Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?	Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.	No, Benjamin.
Oh no. He said that.	Shhhh.
Benjamin?	What?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --	Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Ben.	Mr. McQuire.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --	Yes, sir.
You a student?	Not exactly.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?	I am going to call the police now.
Give me an hour.	What?
What do you drink? Bourbon?	Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you think of me?	What do you mean?
No.	What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.	Like what?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.	So?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.	All right. Now finish your drink.
Her portrait?	Yes.
No.	We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --	No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
But they would! Don't you see?	Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Yes, I do.	I've got to go.
May I sit down?	Of course.
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.	Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
Did you get us a room?	What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?	I haven't. No.
Why don't you get it.	Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well -- goodbye then --	Benjamin.
Well.	Benjamin.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.	That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?	Are you kidding?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?	If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?	Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?	Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.	Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.	You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --	There!
How do you get out of the house?	I walk out.
We're talking.	What?
Right.	Thank you.
Why did you do that?	See if you can guess.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?	Art.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.	Kind of.
Well how did it happen?	How do you think.
Really. I want to know.	It was a Ford, Benjamin.
No.	Why not?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --	Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Do you understand that?	Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
What are you doing?	Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
But it's not.	That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.	But if it's sickening for you --
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.	Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.	I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
The toothbrush. I got it all right.	Very good, sir.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.	When I go off?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.	Goodnight.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.	Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.	Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Well -- when did you decide all this?	About an hour ago.
Well --	About what?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.	No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Thank you very much, sir.	Ben -- how old are you now?
Thank you.	I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?	You'll never be young again.
I know.	Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?	Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.	Yes, sir.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.	Oh yes.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?	No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?	It was nothing to do with you, sir.
You miss the point.	Don't shout at me, Ben.
Can you see me now?	Yes, I can.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.	I'd like to discuss this.
What's happening?	Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.	That what he says. Right?
It's a short life and a gay one...	Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
And what are you going to do?	The pearls are in her room.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.	I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --	You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...	With the pearls?
Like dancing?	Not with strangers.
Oh!	Dictation.  You know...
Reducing?	No -- why? -- should I?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?	Very little.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?	Where downstairs?
I'd given you up.	Sorry.
Chasing around.	Chasing what?
Yes -- I'd love to.	Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.	I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.	I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
You live here?	For tonight. 
Please do not be frightened, Madam.	What do you want here?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?	I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
I want to be alone.	That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I want to be alone --	No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Why do you smile?	Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?	I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I'll not denounce you.	I know.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---	I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
You do believe that I really love you?	Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.	Oh -- yes but -- later.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?	Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
I'm worried about you.	Don't.
Thank you, sir.	Not at all, sir. 
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.	I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...	Yes, quite.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?	A little strange, Baron.
The Baron is tired?	No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
If I could get into a game I might win some.	Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Is that too much, Baron?	No -- not at all.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.	Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.	Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?	Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.	I thought she was splendid!
The war.	That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.	Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --	Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.	Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.	What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Anyone asked for me?	Nobody, Doctor.
Oh -- but -- I --	You're tired. I can see that.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.	Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.	Everything?
Excuse me, gentlemen.	I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.	Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm engaged for the evening.	Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Dance then? 	She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Really?	For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Please -- please!	You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Yes, of course, -- money!	You don't understand that do you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?	What?
No.	Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 	That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
I must go to England -- at once.	Well?
Insolent young cub!	You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh, no.	Why not?
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.	Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
What?	They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I mean with the Manchester people?	We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
No water -- What a place!	All you have to do is phone for it.
I know you did -- I said you did --	And I said we didn't.
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.	Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Sorry, Preysing. 	You've decided against the merger?
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...	Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
If you actually have news from Manchester then...	Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.	Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.	Next week.
How clear is Manchester?	Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...	You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.	He likes to play the great man.
I can't dance tonight --	It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --	Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.	Goodnight, Suzette.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?	I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.	The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.	Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.	You haven't time.
Yes, the police must be called.	No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.	I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
If you will wait one moment, sir.	I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Just one moment, sir.	No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.	The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.	No news yet?
I know -- I know.	I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.	Well -- gentlemen.
Next week.	You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?	He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
He's a good kid. A salesman.	On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
You're a thousand percent right!	Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.	Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.	I like you, too.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.	Hah.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.	Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.	Goody!
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...	So here we are!
Here you are! Two rich people!	I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Yes, yes, but that's --	My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.	Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.	Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.	But they must be! They cut glass!
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...	I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
What? Me?	That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?	Oh, sure. Fine.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.	Perk.
Oh, come on, Roy.	The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
I like those.	You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
Sure.	The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Why?	You don't have the stomach for it.
Roy, I don't want money from you.	I pay my debts.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.	I've really got to --
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.	Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.	As though you do what I say.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?	This way's perfect.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --	You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --	Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.	You must have some money.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?	Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.	Not very good!
For God's sake, Lilly!	I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.	I don't?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?	My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.	Are you sure?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?	No, baby. Come to Mama.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.	You already went back to work.
Nobody does that single-o.	I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.	And when he got serious?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.	Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Running your broker scam, you mean.	You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?	What?
Don't I get any say in this?	No! Because I --
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.	For Christ's sake, why not?
Roy Dillon?	Yes?
I realize this is a shock.	Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Sure. Let's get it over.	One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Well, thank you. And thank them.	Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
One set of muddy shoe prints.	That don't match either of the victim's.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.	Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.	Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Carter.	It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Mind if we sit down?	I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Funny, we just drove right in.	Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Do you know who did this?	Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.	What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.	Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?	My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.	You sure?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...	Nothing's missing?
What the --	Betcha' didn't predict that.
Oh, so now it's my fault?	Just forget it...
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.	Will, sit down...
What?  Where is she?	John...
What are you doing here?!	I came to see you.
Better?	Yeah.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?	I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Linda!  He killed Linda!	Who?!
Hey, you alright?	What?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.	Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.	Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Ooooh, busted.	Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
You're so easy...	Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
He do that to you?	Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?	We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!	Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?	The voice man!  He's here!
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?	But I've seen him!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...	You can't expect us to stay here --
Mommy!!!	Danny!!!
What should I do?	Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
God ... this can't be true.	Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?	It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.	No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --	Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?	Him.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.	Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --	It's a rune ... Thorn.
Halloween.	'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!	Kara, no!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!	That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.	You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.	You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.	It was you.
Yes?	Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!	Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
A bitch.	Didn't recognize you.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.	Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
No.	How all the magazines show tits today.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.	Tell them yourself!
Otherwise, how are things?	I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.	Really?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."	Sorry.
Go to the funeral?	Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
All the more reason to go to Africa.	I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I don't think so.  It could have been.	If what?
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?	What?
Gee whiz--	It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
I wouldn't drop my gun.	You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.	He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.	Out!
Oh hell.	Dad was never in England?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."	"The sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.	Tell me that.
You're supposed to get hurt!	Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.	Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.	Sir?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!	She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.	Penelope!
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!	Damn.
Play?	Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
What's this?	Nothing.
Can I help you, sir?	I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.	A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?	Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.	Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.	Daughter--I love you very much.
This is crazy.	Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What's the matter?	Give us time.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?	I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.	A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Bluh.	You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Your old beau?	We thought it was an emergency.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.	Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.	You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.	I have a brain.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!	What a honeymoon.
That's what you're supposed to say.	This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
It couldn't!	I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Fish can't feel.	Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...	The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
And he keeps it in his apartment?	Yes.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.	No you're not!
I came for Paul as well.	If he wants to go.
Did you like it, dear?	It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.	Hope.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?	It seems highly intelligent to me.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.	Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!	Like what?
I mean it!	Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Help your mother find the bullet.	There it is.  Give it to me.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.	Hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.	Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency!	She still has just the one child-- the boy?
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!	And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.	I came back.
None.	Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.	Are you've seen it work cures?
This is man to man.	It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
You're old--so old.	Now who's being cruel?
You're a son of a bitch.	Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Hands and knees, you say?	And terror, if you don't mind.
You hope.	In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?	No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.	And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Was I ever of use?	Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.	Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Can't do it.	Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Thank you--for my life.	It's trash now, like mine.
Dead!	Jesus.
What happened?	Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
How horrible.	Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
Won't you please join our club? Please?	Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.	Ja?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?	I don't care what she wears.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?	She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
No.	All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
I know.	Stay home tonight!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.	If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
That's an interesting piece of news.	You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.	Still lives with his mother.
In a railroad accident many years ago.	I was afraid to ask.
I hate that thing.	It's beautiful.
Is Norbert still here?	No.
Mom?	That man is your father.
What are his symptoms?	Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
My father!	I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.	How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He isn't?	He is my father.
Yes?	Something happens to my confidence.
I'm touched.	That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Did you see him?	Yeah.
Is he coming home?	He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!	It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Did you talk to Paul?	Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
What was it?	He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.	You're saying no.
You were wonderful.	What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.	What?
This is very good for us.	It is?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.	Why would you do that?
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.	We've got to rescue him.
You fool, you fool.	Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Everything's going to be beautiful.	You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Is that a fact?	That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.	Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.	Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...	Big threat. TV would ream you.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.	Do you have any particular choice of girl?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.	Are you going to stiff me?
What do you mean?	Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Just one.	The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...	Overpowering?
Are you sure it's all right?	Yes. I think it'll look better.
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.	Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Are you Niki?	Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.	Yeah.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.	Three hundred?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.	Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?	I don't drink, but you can go out.
And your wife? Where's she?	She's dead.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.	At least I'm a growing person.
You know what I'm talking about.	You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Say what?	'Sucking off.'
No.	You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.	You really believe all that?
It's not quite the same thing.	It doesn't make any sense to me.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.	Why can't I meet him now?
Grand Rapids? Of course.	On your own land?
Why do you say that?	Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.	Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.	So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.	...What do you have to offer?
I don't know.	What do you mean?
Where is she?	I don't know.
Yeah. Probably.	You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.	Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
I'm only human, you know.	Get out.
Do the police want to arrest me?	Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?	It's just a name.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...	Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Wes, do me a favor.	What?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.	I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.	Let's go.
Fifty cents admission.	What?
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?	I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.	My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.	Film making can be pretty expensive...
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.	Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Not exactly...	It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
I thought you were a businessman.	Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.	Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?	Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What's that?	You never heard of that?
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.	No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.	'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.	Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Could I see your registration?	I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
But there is a family resemblance.	You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
What do you see?	I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Oh, of course. What is your name?	Harold Chasen.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.
Do you sing and dance?	Eh, no.
Yearse!	Oh.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.	It's very interesting.
Harold?	Maude???!
How about some ginger pie?	Eh, fine.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?	Yes. Very much.
It goes on and on.	That's really great.
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.	Certainly a new experience for me.
You don't look eighty.	That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.	Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
What is it?	That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Oh, my. We're too late.	Is he all right?
No.	No more revolts.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.	Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
I <u>think</u> I see it.	Yes. It's almost there.
Well, I really don't smoke.	It's all right.  It's organic.
Did Confucius say that?	Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.	What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.	How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.	It's so blue.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?	No. I feel more like - yodeling.
But they'll put me in jail.	Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...	Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Oh, you weren't scared.	Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
How about some candy floss?	Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Look at the stars.	Yes. They're old friends.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.	You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Farewell?	Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?	Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.	Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!	I don't care what people say.
How do you do?	Can't complain.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?	An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.	Does that worry you?
I put a lot of effort into these things.	Ah, yes.
And a lot of time.	I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No.	What about the draft?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?	I don't know.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?	I go to funerals.
Your classmates?	Yes.
Your studies?	Yes.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?	No.  I'd have liked to.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.	War is not all black.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.	To pit your own life against another.
How about to slit his throat?	Well, I don't...
Stay where you are, Harold .	She took my head.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?	Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
He... he loved me.	Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...	Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...	Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Get out of the way.	Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!	WHY?
O.K. Let's go.	Kyle, you don't have...
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.	And what about you?
Nonsense, I...	It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
He talked about Demons, huh?	Yeah.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.	Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --	You mean, outside... with her.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --	Red, I found something --
Red. How long was it latched onto you?	I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.	Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??	What is it?
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.	Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.	Air and sea backup. What's closest?
Cordon off the area. Something came through.	From where??!!
C'mon -- Rasputin??	Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.	I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Son. About Rasputin --	Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."	"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.	You're doing fine.
Got tired of me?	Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Sir, may I go first??	Not so fast. He barely knows him --
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.	I can live with that.
-- should go back. Now!	No. Don't --
Helping you -- I just --	No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Myers?	Yes?
Hey, your chili's getting cold --	Not hungry.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.	Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.	I like that...
It's freezing, isn't it?	Coffee's warming me up.
That you feel that way about me.	You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Hit me.	What?
Yes, I --	-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Christ!	What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.	Hi.
What's happening?	We're leaving.
The box... you opened it. We came.	It's just a puzzle box.
Many times.	To a man called Frank Cotton?
Just in time.	Stay the fuck away from me.
Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.	Oh Christ.
Julia!	Kirsty?
You bastard --	Poor baby.
Bastard.	Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Well can I come in or not?	I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
What about Larry --	Forget him.
Back from where?	Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.	What do you want me to do.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.	Good.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.	Who?
Later.	What?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.	Hell...
So where's the harm?	I said no.
Maybe we should just leave --	Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
What's the problem?	I have to see my father.
How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.	You mean we're moving in?
You're still blaming me.	No. I'm not.
All right.	So what's the argument?
No argument.	Oh Christ. Julia...
Well?	Why not?
What have you done?	I cut myself.
You're NOT going to faint.	Shit.
Take it slowly.	So damn stupid.
You're done worse.	I'll be scarred for life.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.	Can I get you anything?
Is this upsetting you?	I've seen worse.
Are you all right?	Fine.
Oh baby.	Don't go upstairs.
Well, isn't it?	I... suppose so, yes.
Is this your place ?	Do you care ?
No personal details?	That's right.
This isn't the bedroom.	No.
I suppose not.	I prefer the floor.
Oh Christ.	What's wrong?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?	Steve.
What did you say?	I said: I found a room.
Well I want you to see the house.	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.	What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
What are you drinking, love?	I've forgotten.
I guess.	She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.	Sure.
Get the fuck out of here.	What's the problem?
All right.  No. That's nice.	If there's a train.
Meaning what?	Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
Oh no?	Oh no.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.	I beg your pardon?
Play it.	Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?	Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Nice, Barry.	Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Not the point.	Oh, so what's the point then?
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.	Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
I wanna date a musician...	I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.	That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What?	What do you mean, "what?"
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.	Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.	Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?	Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.	Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.	Suck my ass.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.	Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.	You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Fuck off, Barry.	I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.	Haven't seen it.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.	No.  We need the gig.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?	We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?	Oh yeah.  We got it.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --	I have all of the others.
What?	Nothing.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?	Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."	Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
That's what I said.	No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
A couple blocks!  About six!	We work there!
Anna Moss.	Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
What are you talking about?	Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Sure, but is that it for the list?	That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.	"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?	Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
'Morning, Dick.	Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.	Well, I'll just make it for you.
What's this?	The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Are you all right?	Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.	Fine.
Rob.	Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Rob --!	-- FUCK OFF!
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.	Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
What needs sorting out?	Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
So you weren't interested in music at all?	Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.	You really believe that?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.	Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.	So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I suppose so.	So we have a chance of getting back together again.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.	Fine.  One.
You won't like it.	Just ask it!
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.	Will you please just go?
So, how are you?	Have you slept with him yet?
Will you call me?	I don't have your number.
I figured it was.  Where are you?	I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.	It was kind of funny.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.	That bad, eh?
Hello.	Hey, how ya doin'?
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?	I can't talk right now.
You're soaking.	Mmnn.
What do you mean?	I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.	I don't want to go back.
What?	I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.	It'll have to be sex, then.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.	Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Mission accomplished.	I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.	Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.	Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Where?	At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.	You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.	It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Are you worried about tomorrow night?	Not really.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.	I mean it.
I know.	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?	Not in love, exactly, but...
No.  Probably not.	Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
So?	I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
About what?	This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.	It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Rob here.	Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.	You called this morning?
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?	It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.	What difference does it make?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.	God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.	Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
So you'll stay?	Yeah.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?	God, you ask a lot of questions.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.	Well call her mother.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?	I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.	Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?	It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.	Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
What do you think?	It's the best collection I've ever seen.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.	Sixty.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.	Nice.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.	Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?	Yeah.
No.	I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.	The boy _died_?
-Okay okay.	You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Jesus Christ.	You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?	That bothers you?
I'd rather hear yours.	You are being foolish.
What's all that?	Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
You make it all sound so simple.	The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.	Follow me.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.	At least.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.	A factor of age.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.	I see.
Who are you?	That would be difficult to explain.
He is older than I.	What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Not the same.	What about that family in '31?
What is it like?  Being you?	Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?	The inheritance.
Forget it.	I'm just curious.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.	Now there's a new topic.
A murder.	You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.	Never take up poker, Detective.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.	You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Requiem acer'nam donaei-	What are you doing man?
Stop.	-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Aye.	Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your marks would suggest great injury.	I was nearly killed.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?	Yes.  Always.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.	What?
Listen to me.  Hear the words.	This is madness!
It is the truth.	No!
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.	This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.	That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?	Far away.
Not so scared.	Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish your prayers?	Finish yours?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.	You seem to understand a great deal.
Equals?	If you wish to play games, Major.
You see Major?  You are not so different...	I had no choice.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.	Figure she's with him?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.	Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Smith.  Carl Smith.	How many came?
_Answer_ me.	We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Spare a chair?	Kahn?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?	Sit.
How are you?	Head still secure to the neck.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.	What are you doing here?
And have you something to settle with me?	Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.	I've had a few more concerns.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.	You're wrong.
We have some unfinished business.	Are you here?
Yes laddie, I have her.	Should I care?
This your present address?	Yes.
Did you know the victim?	No.
What were _you_ looking for?	That's none of your business.
Do you know what this is?	I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?	Your murder weapon?
Home.	A neighbor saw your car leave.
The resemblance is amazing.	When may I expect the cleaners?
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?	Hildy!
Who is it?	What's the idea of locking this?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.	Hello, Bensinger.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."	Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
But I don't gamble, Hilda!	I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.	I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?	Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Did you finish the interview?	The Criminal Courts Building.
Hildy!	Hello, Bruce...
Did you give her the money?	No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.	Oh, yes. Here it is.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?	Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?	No -- she didn't.
Anything the matter?	Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
I'm beginning to realize that.	And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?	You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?	Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Call Duffy!	No, you don't!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.	Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
What do you want?	Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.	Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.	What?!!
Sure you can. Come on.	Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --	You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.	Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.	I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Then what does he want with you?	Now you got me.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.	What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!	Oh, I'm sorry.
You said it.	So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.	I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Now you're talking!	You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?	Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.	Hold on a minute.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?	Yes. Where is he?
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!	Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!	You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?	Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Railroad tickets.	Is he coming back here?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.	What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!	Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?	Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!	Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.	When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!	I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!	Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.	That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.	Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Then why are you doing it?	Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Where'd you wire him?	On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?	Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.	Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --	You -- you!!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!	You grey-haired old Judas!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.	I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You know me. The shirt off my back.	You got plenty of money?
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!	Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?	I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.	You said it!
I don't know --	Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?	The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?	Yes, sir.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.	Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.	This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Hold the phone!	I'll have it in a minute.
We know what you're up to.	Probably goin' out to get Williams.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.	Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.	This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
What went off?	Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.	Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Shoot to kill, I said.	I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
And so do I!	So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.	That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.	Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Any news?	Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.	Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.	I thought so, too.
Look out, you --	What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Have you got my dough?	Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Here!	Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Any dope yet on how he got out?	From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Hiding him where?	Mother!
Mother!	That man there!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?	Very simple, Earl.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.	What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Earl, you must never do that again.	Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.	Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 	They're not human!
Where are they gone? You know where they are?	Wait a minute, Mollie.
They'll get him! They'll get him!	Ssh!
What's the idea?	Never mind! Just play dead.
Hey --	Shut up, you!
What's from the Governor?	The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Who? Me?	Who do you think!
But how do I know...?	Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.	I'll explain it tomorrow!
They wouldn't take it.	You're insane!
Here's the picture of my wife.	A very fine-looking women.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --	I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.	Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
What's your hurry?	We want to see you.
Baldwin -- his name is.	I give that marriage six months.
The door was locked.	She and Mollie were talking.
Never let a rat creep up on you.	I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Give him the you-know-what.	Very well, Grandpa.
It's true.	You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Pauline's mum got killed.	No, she didn't.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.	Bugger off.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.	Won't they have maps?
You wouldn't.	Would.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.	Ask her yourself.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.	We thought it was poison.
You're the biggest fibber.	It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.	...and six...
You said that last year, Dad.	The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Who pays for them?	We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....	Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Boy, that was some air-raid.	Air-raid?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?	There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
So you're going to be a grandfather.	And I'm still just a lad myself.
Has Sue got it right?	What's that?
You know it? It must be an old one.	Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
He always knows.	Half the time he's bluffing.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.	The ideas you get in your head.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.	Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
I don't believe this is happening to me.	It's not. It's happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.	Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.	Wasn't it lovely?
It was the best time of his life.	How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
I can't do it. What's the point?	It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...	...since I used to take you to the Proms?
I wish it could all have been different.	Look after yourself, Grace.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.	Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?	I know you mean well.
Molly!	Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.	Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Cone.	Huh... what cone?
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.	Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
I agree.	Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.	Baby! Stop!
Drink up, it's party time.	Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!	Who's your Daddy!
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.	OK.
How much further?	Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.	Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?	Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?	No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?	A dead one.
That's not something to joke about.	OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
What?	You know... a couple of queers.
Do you believe this fucking girl?	I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?	Now, what makes you think that?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.	I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.	Great story Goober, how much?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.	Holy crap, thanks!
But suppose for a second you did.	Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.	Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.	Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Perfect.	I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Really fucking awesome.	Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.	And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Almost there.	Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.	I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Don't look back, just get in the car.	Lock the fucking doors.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.	Where ya headed?
Why are we stopping?	There's a dog in the road.
How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.
Come on, get with the facts.	Hmmmmmmmmm?
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.	The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.	Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.	Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Fuck your grandmother.	Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
How long is that gonna take?	He should be back in a couple hours.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.	What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.	Tickets for what?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?	That seems likely.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?	It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?	I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.	Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.	I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.	That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.	Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.	Sleeping.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.	Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.	Tell me about it.
I don't hear anything.	Shhhhhh, quiet.
A couple hours!	Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.	Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.	I don't doubt that.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.	Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
I'll go. It's my fault.	You said it, not me.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.	What!
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.	Enough with the stupid voices.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.	Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Why? Why are you doing this?	Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Where's Bill?	Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!	This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?	My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.	What! God damn, how many?
I don't know. I only saw one.	I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Get in... now!	Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.	No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.	Right.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.	That's it?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.	How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.	Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And?	And think about what you've done.
You remind me so much of Nathan.	Like father, like son.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.	Woof.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.	French?
Shall we close up, then?	Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.	Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.	It's true. I wouldn't lie.
What is wrong, my darling?	Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.	Shit.  Hi, honey.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?	I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Gabby, what is it?	Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
What is it?	You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.	Unnhh.
Lila?	That's Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.	I don't know. Something's missing.
Nice night.	Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.	Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
That's what I'm counting on.	But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.	I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.	Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Oh?	Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.	Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.	Shut up, you.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.	I'm really glad you two found each other.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.	Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.	I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.	Paper or cloth?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.	I'm not sure.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.	It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...	I like you, too, Nathan.
I don't know. Something.	A deer?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?	I think he's feral.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.	Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
What are you doing in there?	Nothing. Be right out.
Who is it?	Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
So, how's it going today?	Good. Making progress.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.	That's great.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?	I guess.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...	Such as what womanly things?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!	I had sold my fucking soul.
So he's doing okay?	Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?	I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?	Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!	Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.	Ooka.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.	Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.	I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.	Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Extra dessert?	Even better.
Thanks to you, Nate.	Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.	here, here.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?	And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Comin' in or goin' out?	Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?	That's the way it's done.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.	Deal the cards.
Do you really think you can beat him?	Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Only when I work.	Yeah? Why?
Pool.	You being cute?
He drank as much whisky as you did.	Maybe he knows how to drink.
That's your problem.	So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.	How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?	Whaddya been so far?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.	Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.	Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
For me.	That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.	Now, when did you adopt me?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?	Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?	Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.	You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.	Miss Packard. How do you do?
I'll beat him the next game.	How're the hands?
Please don't get off me now.	I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Half.	In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?	Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
He's my partner.	You well-heeled, partner?
You got that wrong, mister. I am.	Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.	Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Why?	Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.	You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Whaddya mean?	Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.	I don't want it.
It's quiet.	Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Hey, how much are we ahead?	Approximately? One thousand bucks.
How much we got?	Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?	Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?	Get with what?
Is this all we got left?	If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?	I asked around.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.	Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?	I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.	How much?
Who's he?	Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Gimme ten bucks.	Ten dollars.
You quittin' too?	You're a pretty good player.
You better not miss, friend.	I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
How long have you been waiting?	Since four.
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?	Fine, thanks.
You don't look like a college girl.	I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
So why go to college?	I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.	I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Why did you do that?	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Why?	Come here.
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."	Thanks.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.	You want to go with me?
You got it all in your head?	When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
You going out?	Yeah. For a little while.
What are you writing?	Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
No. You?	What's it so hot in here for?
He knows. A lot.	Why did he tell you?
He's a gambler.	Is he a winner?
You glad?	Yes, I'm glad.
What do you want to tell me?	Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
No, I want to walk.	Come here. Come on, now.
Oh, grow up.	Why should I?
Fifty-seven.	I'll be up later.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.	Well, what's the matter?
Where do you come from?	California. Oakland.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?	Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Very good shot.	You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.	Game's over, Eddie.
I came to play pool, Fats.	That's good, Eddie. For how much?
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --	You lived like this once.
Yes.	We move.  Place to place.
You want to find them.	Yes.
What choice did I have -- ?!	You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
I only protect myself -- !	You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Do you still want me to stay?	Yes.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.	I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?	They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
You and that damned garden.	Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Only got one kind.	That's fine.
So, what do you do?	I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Wow.  Look at the mountains.	This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
A meteorite, Dad, look!	It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
There are more this year than last.	This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --	I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?	Sure ... fine.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.	I'll take you to school.
What happened to you?  Who was that?	That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
I'm home now.	Yes -- but ...
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.	May I ask why?
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?	No.
Where, Jimmy?	Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I swear it was here.	But it's not, Jimmy.
They'll get us.	We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Does it look to you like anything landed here?	Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
No one comes here after dark.	Hide the car.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?	No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
George, where have you been?	What happened to your other slipper?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.	The back door was open.
When?	This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.	I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.	All right.  I'll be right back.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.	It's really nice of you to help us.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.	I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
What?	Connie, don't hang up.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?	Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?	David, don't...
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.	Punched the President? Oh my god.
You saved a lot of lives.	I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
A countdown to what?	Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.	Can't this thing go any faster?
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?	Dad...
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?	Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?	He wasn't the President then.
Pops, you're a genius!	What'd I say?
We're loose!	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Is my wife in the air?	She should be shortly.
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.	Yes, Sir.
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.	And our troops here?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.	That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.	Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.	This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
You can't go. Call them back.	Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Really? You don't mind?	Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
You're late.	You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Was his father stationed here?	He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
So, what do you do for a living?	I'm a dancer.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.	I thought you didn't recognize me.
I don't need it.	Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
But I gave you some this morning.	I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.	For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
How' he doing?	Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Mr. President?	Deploy.
Call them back.	The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
What do you want us to do?	Die.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?	Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!	All your life.
Your treat.	Yes. My treat.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!	Dad was onto something here!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Marcus!	Arghhh! Oh!
The Word of God...	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Are you expected?	Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.	I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."	The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
An old man's dream.	Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.	You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
I'm through!	We're through!
Fraulein -- will you permit me?	I usually don't.
I usually don't either.	In that case, I permit you.
It would make me very happy.	But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
At least I let you tag along.	Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
No. You like the way I do things.	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.	So it did.
It's important!	Then wait -- count to twenty.
I'll never forgive myself --	Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Dad, they come in through the doors.	Good point.
Found it.	He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
...you did it.	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
They want my diary.	Yeah?
Dad!	...the solution presents itself.
Come on, Dad. Come on!	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
My Diary's in Berlin.	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.	What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.	Booby traps?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.	What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.	What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
What does that mean?	I don't know. We'll find out.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.	Fly... yes. Land... no.
Dad, are we hit?!	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Those people are trying to kill us!	I know, Dad!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".	"J".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!	I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Uh-huh.	After you, Junior.
Get that camel out of the way!	What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?	Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.	This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?	Something magical. A sacred rock.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?	Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.	Miss Scott panicked?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.	Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
I believe we're being called to dinner.	Finally!
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --	No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
What?	We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
Who?	It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?	His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...	Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
You understand what he tells us?	Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?	Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
What's that?	A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Indy, look!	That's it. Pankot Palace.
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.	Why?
Come one, what's wrong?	Behind you!
No, the stones are mine!	You're betrayed Shiva. 
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.	Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
It is why Krishna brought you here.	Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?	Siam.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?	Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.	What?!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.	THE WHAT?!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?	Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.	I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?	I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.	Don't catch cold.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!	That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!	Quiet!
So now they believe me.	Yes, they believe you.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.	Not quite.
Give me your hat...	What for?
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!	Willie, come on!
My name is AL.	Al ???!!!
Who?	Al.
Al.	Yes?
You're in my head...	Yes.
Your name is Al...	Yes.
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.	What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?	I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?	Where are we?
Yeah...Who?	Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
You've heard of U.S.T.?	I just went there for a job.
Why he's argumentative?	Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
You'll be alive.	With a man in my head...
Anyone there?	No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Behind us?	Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
A lab and equipment.	Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.	Who did?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?	I can't remember..
You need ID in there?	You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?	Just scratched my arm, why?
I'm back.	I'm at the airport.
What is it?	Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
What do we do?	Send a man there. A secret agent.
I don't have any.	Use my credit cards.
It's illegal.	Who cares?
What's wrong with how I carry myself.	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
The beach?	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
It's sand.	For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Beautiful!	What was?
She doesn't seem to understand.	Try another language.
Help me out, will you?	What can I do? You're on your own.
What do I do?	Don't just stand there, say something.
What?	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.	.
Without your pants.	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.	Rene...
Get close to them.	That place. By the window.
Follow that busboy.	Are you serious?
Just don't show fear.	I don't know what's going on.
Voice stress analyzer.	Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Even Rene?	She's the toughest to read.
What is it, your charm?	This just won't work.
What Happened?	I don't know!
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..	Is that all?
Some agent you are.	Why don't you get out of my face.
Don't you think I stand out like this.	We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
What do I do?	Follow her.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.	That's not funny.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.	You think. That's what you're good at.
What?	Never mind, just say it.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.	Probably.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.	And Dieter?
What happened?	Losing power. The laser drained it.
Be quiet.	Where've you been?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.	Rene?
JOE What abilities...?	Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
No!	Oh, I can't.
I didn't do anything.	I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
I knew you were trouble.	Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
How about a deal?	We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Bit expensive, sir.	It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
What are you doing here, where've you been?	I have a new client.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.	It's just money.
...Foreign service.	And how do you service foreigners.
It may have been affected.	Oh.
When you remember...	Remember what?
Don't you want to get out?	Oh....Sure.
Al?	The little man in my...  ...head...
Ahhh...nothing.	Been complaning of hallucinations.
Was quite excited, when he came in...	Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Don't do it!	Just give me the keys.
Yes...What is it?	What's what?
Oh...and who is it!?	I didn't say anything.
The poet...something he said...	Yes?
What's so funny?	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
What way?	Like there's someone else here.
Wait. What's your name?	...Rene.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..	It's not apparent.
Can I help?	You are.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?	You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.	Why do you do it?
Why?	You seemed interesting.
Your friends, did they ask about me?	They kidded me a little.
He didn't.	No.
Who did?	You did.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.	This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
This business is over.	I'm sorry. What will you do?
You know where he went?	What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.	He must be a good friend.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?	How do you know you can trust me?
Where we going?	Beats me.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.	Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
What?	He plays it all the time.
That must be him. Water taxi.	Get us one.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.	You've  been there?
I know the territory.	You coming along?
Why not?	Can you?
What happened?	I can't fly it.
Are you alright?	Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
How?	What?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!	You're gonna laugh.
It wasn't me. It was him.	It was you.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...	I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Is there anything else?	A drink...
You can't take that.	Why not?
It will be fine. You have another.	Just one. The back up.
Right there.	Thank you.
The other working.	Perfectly.
I'll take some.	Instant rice...?
He's into kind of little cars, that...	That remote control thing?
Three hours.	You got a deal. 
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?	You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?	Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
So, what are you going to do?	Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...	End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?	No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.	I'm not touching my film...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...	Before you go...
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?	Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
I'm gonna do a follow-up.	Okay. 
Mike... Mike... Mike...	"Mike?"
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?	You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.	Okay.  Lowell?
Why?	Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?	Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
I can take her.	Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?	Yes, it's on the stove...
What do you need at the store?	Soy sauce...
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?	No, thank you.
Use the bathroom.	What's the difference...
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...	Can we talk about this when I get back?
Will independent sources corroborate that?	Hello? Yeah...
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?	...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What are you and Mike going to do?	I'm alone on this...
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?	Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.	I'll call you then.
It would be better if he called us.	Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.	What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...	You eating with us?
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...	Hardly new news.
So, is everything okay?	How are the rooms? Comfortable?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.	Good.
Lowell.	"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.	I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Yeah.	You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
I disappeared on you?	Alright. What did you think?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?	Oh, lots.
That Canada story? Still interest you?	Everything interests me.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.	That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!	What are you talking about? Where are you?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.	Good. I want to talk to you.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.	Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?	Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Next to your father?	My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Why?	They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...	...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Excuse me. Yeah...	They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
You attract a crowd.	Yeah, great.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...	No.
No? No, what?	I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.	And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
You manipulated me into this...!	That's bullshit, Jeff!
Did he hear you?	You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?	There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?	Liane has filed for divorce...
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.	Right.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?	A delivery device for nicotine.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...	And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Poor communication skills.	And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...	Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Baby. You are so HOT!	Howard!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.	You did good, Massey!
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.	She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.	We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.	Is that... one person?
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.	Mr. Dumbarton.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.	Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
I don't need it.	You want Botox?
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.	We did not.
You're in check.	I should be in therapy.
What?	The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Is she Asian?	Asian? No.
I have it.	You have the pre-nup?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.	Yes?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.	So, that's good, right?
Is Tong older than Ming?	I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.	And you must be Mr. Massey.
I assume this is on Rex?	Isn't everything?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?	Have you ever been married, Miles?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.	You just haven't met the right person.
What is it you're after, Miles?	Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?	Absolutely.
Getting married.	To him? He's a sick freak.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.	Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
Yes? Marylin?	You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? When did I say...?	I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?	I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.	Thank you.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?	Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Is that you?	Me. Yes.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --	She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.	Boy. Boy, oh boy.
And here I thought my mother was...	Your mother was.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.	No.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.	I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.	What is it Miles?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?	Yes, Miles. I accept.
You do?	Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.	Do you want to sleep on it?
But?	I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms	I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
I have a surprise for you.	I bet.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!	May I come in?
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.	I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
STUFF.  Got a light?	What kind of "stuff?"
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.	That's blackmail.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...	Please! Leave the house.
Murder!	I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Rex. Get away from the door.	Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
I was devastated. Of course.	Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Miles Massey.	Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?	By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Lilly's up.	Oh, God!
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.	Shit.
You're not...	No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.	I want to be exposed.
What?	He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.	He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?	Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?	Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Mr. Rexroth.	Rex, please.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.	That's her job. You have to respect that.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?	I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?	Video.
In anticipation of making you sick.	Maybe I should reconsider my...
And she has...?	Video.
Wrigley!	Sorry.
What do you think?	What are they?
She owes me a meal.	I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...	-- the coin?
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.	We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Three is not Farrow.	Who's Rex's guy?
How is she?	Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.	"I found a million dollar baby—"
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—	If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.	Yes, I know—but—
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.	I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
South America!	We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!	I'll get it annulled.
What've you got against King Westley?	Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .	That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.	Oh, yes. I heard.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.	Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—	Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
It's my daughter! Go after her.	Lower the boats!
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.	No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
What would you like to have me do?	Sock her!
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?	Yes, sir.
We've done that already.	Yes, of course.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.	Any others?
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.	There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
No.	"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Whadda you want!	If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 	Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.	Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.	Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
I beg your pardon!	Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 	Are you talking to me?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.	Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?	Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?	I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.	Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.	You must have me confused with—
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.	Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Of course I do. What do you mean—	Beat it! 
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.	Are you talking to me!
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 	Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—	Smart aleck!
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...	The pleasure is all mine.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.	Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.	I can't go out like this.
Like what?	Like this. I have no robe.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.	I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.	What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.	Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.	No. No. It's too good a story.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.	Um. You're doing all right.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!	You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
Oh, so now I was drunk!	Well, you were!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?	You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]	Next week "East Lynne."
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.	How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
It takes money to buy food.	Why, haven't you—?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.	You didn't give that boy all your money?
Aren't you afraid of me?	No.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.	That's silly.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.	And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not a one.	You're prejudiced.
Peter—	What?
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.	Well, take them off.
Sure.	What?
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?	Doesn't sound very exciting.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.	Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Carrots.	Raw?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."	There's no end to your accomplishments.
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]	You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.	When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You! Don't make me laugh.	You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]	Why not? I'm hungry.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?	Come on—get in.
Any luck?	Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
I hope you got your money.	You bet I did.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—	Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?	Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.	Who—me?  Want to see me?
No harm in your coming to see us.	Not interested. 
You bet we did.	It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!	Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.	You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—	Get out!
Up yonder. See the lights?	Yeah.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?	What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.	You mean about the Andrews' kid?
If it's on the level.	Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?	I am, Joe.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.	Well, I'll be—
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.	Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
What?	I ain't got a hat.
Funny couple, ain't they?	Yeah.
A trumpet?	Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Mush. Mush.	"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—	He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.	That's right.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.	You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.	Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.	I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.	My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.	I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.	Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.	You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.	You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
And Oswald?	Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.	I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.	God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.	Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Bill.	Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.	Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.	No, I'm not...
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."	Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.	Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.	Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?	Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
But why?	To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...	Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?	He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
...ever called Dean Andrews?	No, I did not.
You still questioning any Cubans?	Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
...give me protection?	Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?	Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.	I see.  And where did you drive?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.	I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why?  What's wrong?	Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?	Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?	Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
And Shaw?	Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
What about Ruby?	Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
No.	But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.	Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Dad, look what I drew.	That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.	I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?	Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.	Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!	The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.	And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.	Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.	I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
I don't believe it!	Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 	This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
I'm not sure I understand.	Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?	Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.	It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.	Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?	One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?	Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.	Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Honey, you all right? 	It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.	But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
My sympathies.	Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.	Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.	Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.	How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Get a hold of yourself.	I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.	You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
And if you're wrong?	I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.	Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.	Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.	You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.	Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?	What are you driving at, boss?
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.	I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?	I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?	Who?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.	Allen Dulles?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.	Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?	I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?	Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Pictures like this don't show up on television!	Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Jim Garrison?	Yes.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.	Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.	I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?	No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.	But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.	His name?
And he never hit you before?	Never touched me.
How much more?	I don't know if I should talk about this.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?	Was he there often?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?	There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?	It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
Sure sounds like he's winning.	He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?	Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?	I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?	If you must know, virtually nothing.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.	The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.	How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?	Yes.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.	Who was there for your ass?
What'd ya mean?	Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?	Course you didn't.
You got a good lawyer?	Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Great, you're here.	Hey, Jackie.
What's she want?	She wants to go back to work.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.	What time do you have to be there?
Can we stop for cigarettes?	Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.	It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.	You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
He's the one who wants you.	It was the other guy who busted me.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.	Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
Thanks, but I have my own now.	You went out this morning and bought a gun?
What, I couldn't hear you?	You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Want to hear some music?	Sure.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.	What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?	No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Well, hello.	Surprise.
I walked right past you.	I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
"American President"	How was it?
You talk them into it?	They seem to like the idea.
I see.	You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
You're avoiding the question.	Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
What do you do when he comes home?	Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Did you do it that night?	He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
How'd you find out?	All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?	People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.	I'm sure.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.	You'll get over that.
I thought you were tired of your business?	I'm just tired in general.
What if I plead guilty?	And cooperate? You might get probation.
He say we like the same thing as married.	Do you live together?
Most of the times.	Not every day?
Then how do you know he sells guns?	He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?	Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.	You two meet?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.	Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.	Who's the other one?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.	She told you that?
Uh-huh.	Was she there?
She didn't say.	But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
We could, if I'm not in jail.	Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
What did you do after that?	I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.	I thought you were watching him.
Uh-uh.	Gimme one anyway.
How the fuck they know that?	I told them.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.	I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Plus the same deal as before.	I can do that.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.	What the hell you talkin' bout?
I was there, I saw her do it.	Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.	She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?	She don't know shit about the money.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.	We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Four years?	Uh-huh.
With Ordell?	We had done time together already.
C'mon, don't lie.	I don't like dancing.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.	Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.	I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He went to meet that stewardess.	Does that bother you?
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?	Uh-huh?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.	And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...	Uh-huh?
We're leaving now!	All right already.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.	Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.	What's your cost?
Uh-huh.	C'mon in.
How much is there?	Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.	What does that mean?
Uh-huh.	Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
It's Louis.	Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.	When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?	That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You shot Melanie?	Twice. In the parking lot.
Where did you shoot her?	In the chest and stomach.
Then what?	We went to the parking lot.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.	Maybe the Feds got it.
You know who I saw in the dress department?	Tell me.
They don't have your winning personality.	Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
That's Winston. He works here.	He's a big one. You two tight?
Yeah.	It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Who's it for? A relative?	Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.	You think you could do that?
Comfortable?	The door was opened, so I just came right in.
It still sounds high.	She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.	Did the police contact you?
Brown, Jackie Brown.	What does she do for you?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?	Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?	She got off, huh?
I'm alone.	Git your ass in here.
We're back.	'Ola!
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.	I was gonna tell you...
What do you want?	Just to see you. That's all.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.	No, don't. But thanks.
You're hurting me!	Stop!!!!
Well, try, huh.	I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.	There's nothing to expose.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?	Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Hey, wait!	Don't bother to call again, okay?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.	This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?	Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
I'm too messed up to teach.	Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.	You need ... a doctor.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?	Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.	War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.	Why do you say that?
What do you mean, demons?	He told me he was going to Hell.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.	How long had that been going on?
You think they're connected?	I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.	How do you know?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.	I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Ah!	I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?	I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.	I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.	Hell, you think I am?
What was that?	It's freezing.
Where are you?	If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
That help?	Thanks.
What happened to you?	Don't ask.
Where'd you leave 'em?	I don't know.
Thanks.  What's that?	Your kid dropped it off.
What?	Why you left.
Is that the one who died?	Gabe.
You okay?	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.	Where are we?
What's it say? A hundred and two?	I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
What does it say?	It's gone to the top.
What the hell are you doin'?	Get your clothes off.
Don't gimme that.	Lie down!
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?	You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
While you were in the shower.	Why didn't you call me?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.	I don't believe this.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?	Stay away from me, Jez.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.	Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.	I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?	Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.	Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
You come here often?	Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.	I don't know.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.	No. I couldn't.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.	I don't know what to say.
You got a nice tan, though.	Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Dream on!	What?!
Push 'em back.	Help me!
We're doing everything we can.	Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Lennox Hospital.	I'm awake?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.	Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
The army?	She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?	Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
A car accident.	Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Is he all right?	He doesn't like it.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.	Speaking of which, duck!
Asshole that does not count as a kill.	Yes it does.
I don't have all day, kid.	Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Duck fuckers?	He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!	What do you mean, not enough time?
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.	We're not leaving Crutch!
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.	Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
You see that?	Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Shit!	The hull's imploding!
Hey! I'm not ready.	Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Goodbye, my love.	Thorgan, suit up.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.	Then stop talking and work faster!
Earth II.	Suit up.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.	Not a chance.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.	At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.	No, you're dead! You're all dead!
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.	Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.	I hope so.
We're screwed!	400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if you miss?	What if we don't?
Rizzo?!	It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Did you like it?	I think so, why?
It's time.	What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!	Oh I like her a lot.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!	She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!	I'm on my way.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.	Well, do something!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!	Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?	Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.	Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
No.	Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
I don't know...sorry?	Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
It's just you and me, then.	Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Kay-Em, you okay?	Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Kay-em you okay?	I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
The power's back up!	Then open the doors!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?	We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?	If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?	Nanotechnology.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.	We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.	Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.	Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You're not going anywhere.	You wanna die?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?	Exactly.
Guys, he's right behind us!	It's okay.
My cars. And a comic book.	Here --  Take him home.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.	Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.	We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
He's trying to sink us!	Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.	Full throttle! To port!
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?	'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Home... New York?	No. Home here.
Colorful, isn't he?	You going to be all right?
Now tell me something I don't know.	All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!	That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.	Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Got a pen on you?	Why?
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.	Maybe we can save August...
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.	You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?	Who are you?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?	Swell.
What? What?!	Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Where'd you get all this?	I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?	It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
What happened?	I want to check something. Hold my feet.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.	You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I hope we get some more help.	I wish it would rain...
This has got to be one big violation...	This is quite a place.
Think the tide's with us?	Just keep kicking.
And nobody else saw her in the water?	Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?	We never had any. What's the problem?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.	I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.	Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Well... is everything all right?	Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.	Let me see your hands...
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.	I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
What's that supposed to prove?	Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
I'll drink to your leg.	And I'll drink to yours.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.	I think I can top that, Mister...
Follow him!	He's under!
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!	Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.	So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.	I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Is that normal?	I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.	What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.	You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
I try really hard, actually...	No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.	You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.	Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear it's yours?	Yup.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.	What are you talking about?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?	I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.	You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?	Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
No.	Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?	I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?	They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?	I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?	Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.	Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.	Geeeerta Rauuuss!
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.	Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?	What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.	I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Like what?	Commercials.
Oh.	Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!	I wrote that.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...	Hey, I like this.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?	Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.	You're something else.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.	I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Cold feet.	You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Cool.	Come on, I have something for you.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?	I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.	Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
You should try Adderall.	No thanks. I'm off pills.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?	Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.	I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Juno? What's going on?	Nothing.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?	I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.	Congrats.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...	My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.	You're pregnant?
What?	Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.	I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?	Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.	You mean like couples?
I sort of already have.	Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?	I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!	Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.	I am a suicide risk.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.	I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.	Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?	Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
You're not listening to me.	No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?	Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.	Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.	Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Juno, what's the matter?	She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
What would be a good time for you?	I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.	No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Are you takin' the pictures?	...Yeah.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.	He whips you?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?	You can?
You took this picture?	Took 'em all.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!	...That's not true.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?	Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
...I don't know.	Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!	Early! Stop!!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?	Not so good. You sure you have to?
Brian.	Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Henry Lucas.	Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
...and?	They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.	Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.	...I do.
So how's it going?	...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...	Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Carrie.	I don't want to talk about it.
What's that?	A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.	Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Brian I want him out of our car!	Why, what did he do?
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.	Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?	...Brian hurt his foot.
...never?	No, never. Excuse me.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.	Wasn't my fault...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.	What is it?
What happened?	Who are you?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.	Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
How many times have you gone unprotected?	With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
What do you think?	You fucked it?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!	Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Well, how was it?	Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
She can fuck?	Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Oh shit. How long did it take?	Did what take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.	How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.	Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.	Yeah.
Shit.	What do you want?
You wanna go to Paul's house?	What for? That guys a dick.
78th.	Den less go Joe.
You got any money?	Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Well, those guys share everything, right?	Right.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?	Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Man, this guy is really good.	He looks like my uncle.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.	Darcy?
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.	Yeah.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.	Bet.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?	I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.	So.
Nah.	Why not? You stink.
Where you goin' tonight?	Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I'm goin'. You on the list?	Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?	Na.
You sure?	I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.	Yeah. Do it again.
I thought you had a girlfriend.	Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.	I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Do you like kissing me?	Yes.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.	Nothing?
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.	I don't want you to hurt me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.	Do you care about me?
What is it?	Bang up stuff.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.	No, Fidget, I...
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.	No...
What do I want to do?	You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.	But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.	Do you care about me?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?	No.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.	What?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.	You're OK?
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.	A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?	No.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.	What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Your a real philosopher.	Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
The pain. The fucking pain!	And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
You are being ripped open.	I know.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.	Foreplay. Foreplay.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.	Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Wish me luck.	Good luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.	I only did it once and...
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.	Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I'm coming.	No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!	Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Oh shit.	And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.	Yeah I get bored.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.	Did they ask you a lot of questions?
I hate 'em.	It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?	You've heard the stories right?
So that's why Casper is how he is.	Oh god. That's horrible.
Not too late.	Four-thirty in the morning?
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.	If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Hello?	It's me. Telly.
Hello?	Paul it's Telly. Open up.
What are you guys doing?	Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.	That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Slow.	It's grandmother style.
Right.	And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever	To come?
By yourself?	Yes.
We seem to have a little problem here?	What kind of problem?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?	You are!  I don't like you.
What's that supposed to mean?	It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
Morpheus.	What?
Are you crazy?	Let's see how much he wants to play.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.	You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?	You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
You got it on the board.	No, I need the original note.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.	I was at the beach.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?	I'm positive.
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.	Run it down.
Take it easy.  Both of you.	I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
No shit!	Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Ready for round two?	I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?	I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Hello, Peter.	Who is this?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.	I haven't got time for this.
And -- what path is that?	We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Hello?	Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
But you said you didn't know her.	I know what I said!  She looks just like...
And you want these girls to feel your pain?	Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
Have you any idea what the message is?	If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.	Very good.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."	You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!	Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.	No!  Wait!!
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.	Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Now what?	Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
What is it?	New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?	You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
It worked out alright, didn't it?	Fuck off!
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.	How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?	You're losing me.
You must be Erica.	Uh huh.
Do you like my dad?	Of course.
You ready?	For what?
How long has she been dead?	Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?	Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Anything?	Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
What about prints?	No prints.
You mean, no prints but hers?	No Frank.  No prints.
Same as the others?	Yeah.
What time did he get there?	About a quarter to one.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.	We're going to work on the message.
Could you tell me where you were last night?	Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?	To my room and then I went for a walk.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.	That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!	How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?	Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?
Then I'll transpose.	On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
We got a problem?	Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Bainbridge Books.	Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?	What are they, please?
Is this your first time here?	Yes.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.	How come you don't stay with them?
It seems like such a complicated game.	Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.	Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.	If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
That's a very personal question.	I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
You.	Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?
They couldn't break the riddle.	Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
You sure you don't want to eat something?	I don't think I could.
I think it's interesting.	Another kind of game?
I'm just curious.	I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Of course.	Why?
Alright.  What about me?	I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It was.	And you?
What is this?	I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.	What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
I just don't want to fight with you.	Then show me who you are.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.	I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.	You don't understand.
This letter.  I've never opened it.	Why not?
I'm not nervous.	Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.	Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?	In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...	You must move away from the Center.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.	It was a platonic kiss, Father.
They have Lyssa!	You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
The White Castle has fallen.	Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.	Turold's son was to marry her.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.	I have no extraordinary powers.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.	Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
There is no other way.	But there is another entrance to this place.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.	Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
You choose these?	Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.	Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.	The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!	He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!	I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!	Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!	Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
I can. Because I choose it.	I forbid you!
How did you know?	I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
It is today?	Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.	Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.	Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?	Yes.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.	You will not, then?
Help! Help! I'm drowning!	I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?	A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.	What business?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.	Hah! You don't know me, boy.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.	Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.	These we'll pay for.
We could reach it on fire-mares.	Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
What is that awful looking place?	The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...	First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.	Would you desert your friends?
Put me down, you lout!	You had better manners as a pig.
Passable, pimple, very passable.	The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.	You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Freylag's stronghold?	It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.	Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.	It is important to assure the succession.
A fine match.	They will have the life that you and I might have had.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.	How many did you lose?
She has the power of vision.	She has the power to kill.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.	It's a hundred leagues from here.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.	That is true.
She was not as beautiful.	No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?	We had no children.
You see?	Yes.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Knowledge.	Of what?
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?	Why must you know?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.	Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
I cannot stop the sand.	You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
What's that man's name?	Why do you want to know?
Give me his name, I will mail him.	OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.	Yeah... How do you know it?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?	No?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?	No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?	...Not at all.
OK, I'm fine.	Good.
Wow! It's brilliant!	Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
The yellow and pink.	OK.
Mathilda? May I come in?	Yes.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.	Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
May I go to the cinema?	No.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!	No, you can't go out.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.	OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.	And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
When I say I love you.	Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.	What shall we do?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?	Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Risky business, isn't it?	...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!	Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Poor darling, and then?	Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?	...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!	Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?	...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
May I ask you a personal question?	...Yes.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?	Yeah, what?
I don't know... Five minutes.	Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.	It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Don't fear.	I have no fear.
You can't sit here like that.	Huh? Why?
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?	Messina.
...Who sent you?	Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?	No...
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.	You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Salute.	Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.	I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Do you recognize him?	...Even his mother wouldn't.
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.	May we have this wolf's name and address?
He probably just went somewhere.	Where?
This smells good.	Why am I such an authority?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.	No it's not.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.	How serious is it?
I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?	That's enough.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.	Okay.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?	It's just a regular day.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.	We can do it together.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?	Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
I do love you... very, very much.	Show me.
Walk with me?	You like to take walks?
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.	Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
I know where my heaven is.	Where?
You don't have to prove anything to her.	I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
What's his story?	His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Red flag, man.	If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.	This guy's not a murderer.
Shit!  He jumped!	Jumped where?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.	By car right?
What happened?	Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?	I told you.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.	So I've been informed.
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?
In a hospital.	Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.	You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.	Someone should be with you.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?	Forty-seven years.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.	What do you mean?
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.	No alcohol?
Orange soda?	No.
Sparkling apple cider?	No.
Mind if I use the bathroom?	Of course.
Want a drink? I'm having one.	A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
If I was I'm sorry.	No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
What's up?	I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.	I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.	Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
How long have I been here?	Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What do you mean?	What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Sera...	Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't you like me, Ben?	Don't be silly?
Sera... what you don't understand is...	What?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?	I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?	Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?	OK.
Why?	Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
I'm going to fill it right now.	Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.	Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.	We?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.	I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.	OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.	How much, do you think?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.	Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
You have been lonely?	I am lonely, Yuri.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.	I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.	I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?	That's not what's important.
It's so shameful...	Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.	I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?	I guess.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?	Because they got wet.
Dewey Newcomb?	Who's askin'?
Come again?	Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Was she carrying a weapon?	No, she was crying her eyes out.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?	Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?	Just the love in my heart.
Yes?	Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?	Definitely! I love him!
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!	I'm so happy for you!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.	Licensed attorney or family member?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.	You know her?
The idiot speaks.	Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Warner can't even do his own laundry.	I know. He has it sent out.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.	You think?
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?	Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!	Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
We still love you. Sisters forever!	Thank you. I love you, too.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?	The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Good luck.	Thanks again for your help!
Aside from that.	She's completely untrustworthy.
Why?	She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
How can you still believe she's innocent?	You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Whoa -- Why?	Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
So now you're -- ?	Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!	Oh, my God!!
Up for a celebration dinner?	Are you asking me on a date?
Someone missed you.	Is he the only one?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.	What happened?
Yes? Ms. Woods?	I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?	She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Class schedule, map, book list.	Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.	I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.	You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
C'mon. Let me take you home.	No.
You go where?	Harvard. Law school.
Now I am.	I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
I didn't mean --	Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
In court. On opposing sides.	Are you serious?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.	Why do you say that?
We come watch... we come watch...	Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
What?	Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
We watch... good fun...	Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.	You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!	I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
Do you feed on mice and rats?	I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!	Do it now!
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...	Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.	I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?	Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Flozen foleva not good.	It's terrible.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?	I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.	Gump, is it?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.	I'm in no mood for dancing.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?	Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.	Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.	Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?	I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.	What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.	Better we eat him than the other way round.
What is it?	Something's coming.
Pregnant, is she?	It would appear so.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.	Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
My God!  Look!	Something the matter?
Certainly understandable.	Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...	Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Is she... dead?	No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...	The chill is worse this night.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.	It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Easily spoken...	Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.	Will you chance a miss?
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.	I don't... understand.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...	In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!	Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.	I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...	Don't get too far!
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.	Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Barely living, from the looks of it.	No, no, no... this is different!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!	Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!	They've fired the moat!
Aye... my Lord...	Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.	Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
A gentleman would offer water.	Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
What shall we do?	Be patient.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.	I'll go search for it.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.	Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?	It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.	Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
No!  I won't let it happen...	You've freed me, Jack...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.	I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Biting you?	Pinching me!
Step lively now!	His feet shall never cross my lips.
What's this now?	I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.	The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
I don't believe you.	Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.	Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.	Be fair, Oona.
What's she doing?	I think she's about to foal.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.	Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...	Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.	No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.	Oh, but I have.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...	I'm sending you back to Hell!
Can you show us the way?	To Castle Couer de Noir?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...	A castle's but stone and mortar --
And video games after!	Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
What's that for?	Mom said I should.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.	I don't think Dad wants you home.
Do you guys feel like painting?	What color?
I couldn't get it to go down.	And why was the alarm on?
Why?  What do you mean?	Uh...using Josh like that.
Are you his friend?	No.
I had them in my pocket.	I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
You're a good girl.	I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Where's your dad?	He jumped into the ocean.
He's a freak.	You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.	Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.	Really?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?	No thanks.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.	I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.	Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
We're not gonna do anything.	Why are you so stupid?
Josh said...	I'm not gay.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?	Okay.  I guess.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.	If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
This is such a street of whiners.	From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.	He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.	He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
I have the permit.	After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.	I hate this job.
Well, it's the least I can do.	Yes, it is.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.	Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.	Thank you.
George, this is the third time.	The plumber's due out on Friday.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.	You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!	You don't have a choice.
No one would blame me if I left!	I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!	It'll be fine.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.	You'll have money when you work for it.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!	I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.	The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.	We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know the feeling.	How do you become something you're not?
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.	He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
If I asked you to stop, would you?	I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?	Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.	This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.	Good for you.
What would you do?	I'd build a house.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.	A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.	Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.	I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
It's okay.	She needs to be alone, I think.
When's school over?	Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Last time you were gone for a week!	Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
I did say he could go.	Let's go.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?	That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.	Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.	No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.	What did I say?
I'm married.	You bit my finger.
Peter left me yesterday.	Left you?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'	What did he say?
Are you going to kiss me?	It's not my back that's killing me.
What's your deal with Alyssa?	Don't even...I'm there.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.	I'm thinking it's too weird now.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.	I could use the money.
We've eaten.	Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
The biggest waste of time since television.	Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.	So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?	What are you doing home?
Despite you.	I never asked for more.
That's the problem.	Please don't leave me.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.	That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
No.	Take it off.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.	Do you like red?
Do you know anything about building a house?	No.
You're sure about this?	Yeah.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.	Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?	Can we really help build a house?
Adam, that's not true!	Yes, it is.
No, nigger.	Nigger.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?	Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.	I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Yeah...	Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
She always said that if you were on the outside...	But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?	Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
You know I trust you, Claude.	Yes, sir.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.	You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.	Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Engagement ring!	That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?	Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.	He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.	Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.	I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Sure I do. What's your name again?	Claude Banks.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.	You went to Monroe?
No, tell me what's so funny.	I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.	There is no Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?	Oooh...
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.	That jelly you were talking to right here?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.	That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
You lost all our money in a card game?	He even got my daddy's watch.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!	Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?	Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.	Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --	Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Does that mean I'm in?	I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Don't mention it.	Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.	He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.	Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
You get ketchup?	Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.	All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.	My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Crop duster.	I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.	I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.	That was five years ago.
What?!	You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?	He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.	Goodnight, Ray.
Back to New York for starters.	And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.	Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.	I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.	He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.	You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.	You didn't get ketchup?
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.	Yeah? You and what army?
How you doin'?	I'm all right.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?	Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!	Made just for you, Cookie.
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.	My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?	No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
What are you doing here, mama?	I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?	He must still be in there.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!	I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Lemonade?	I prefer bourbon.
What's going on here?	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.	Are you offering me a bribe?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?	They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.	Greenville, that the nearest town?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?	Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
What's your name?	Me? Willie Long.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?	I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.	You found him.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?	That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?	Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.	But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Little Nicky.	Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Now will you get in the flask?	Absolutely not.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.	And he's dead serious.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.	You mother...
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.	You want a queen? Got one right here.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."	Well tell her I said "hi" back.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.	Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.	You're already there...
Where is he? He's late.	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.	I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.	It's not me, moron.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!	It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.	Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?	Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Knock, knock.	Yes, Jimmy.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Check one-two. Check one-two.	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?	I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.	What was it called, sir.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.	By she, do you mean he?
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.	'Bout time...
What's with that guy?	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.	Should we wake him up?
That's a big pass, Elton John.	We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Schnapps...	Peppermint... alright.
Which way did he go?	That way.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?	Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.	Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.	That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
The South.	Really?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.	My dad's an optometrist.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!	"Octopus people?"
You have a dog? What kind?	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.	Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Don't do it.	I have to, Valerie.
Do me.	I love you.
Off limits.	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I'm a Sandman!	I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?	Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.	Where do you send them?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --	Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
What other food?	Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?	Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.	Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
You missed something special.	Well... you can't have them all.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.	I'm fine...  See you...
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.	Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!	...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Where do you live, Mary?	Here.
What's wrong, Available?	Please... No.
Well then...?	Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Yes... probably he was renewed?	He was killed.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.	No.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?	You know.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.	All right.
Why show me?	I'm going to run.
About running, dying what?	Both... running's what I'm interested in.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...	And I never heard of Sanctuary.
Are you here to help me?	What do you need?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.	You're not going, are you?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast	Muscle? I don't know that one.
I'm afraid.	It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?	It doesn't make any difference anymore.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.	I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.	Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.	Do you think he was telling the Truth?
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.	Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
What does it mean?	The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?	"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
We can't. We're going back.	To what?
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?	Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And Sanctuary?	Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?	Yes...
Are you sure?	Mother and Father said so... you know?
What kind of jewel is this?	I don't know.
What belongs to the people?	All this. All of it.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...	We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Come with us.	Where are you going?
We're leaving.	What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?	More... many more.
Well? How do you like it?	I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?	Too little.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.	You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Sure, what's wrong with that?	Okay.
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?	This is our bedroom.
Very strange.	What is?
No.	Maid? Relative?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.	I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
How'd the camera get so high like that?	And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?	Or not so recently?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.	You know what I think?
How would you like to take me to dinner?	I don't know.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.	Over there.
I don't know.	We should stop seeing each other.
You like it?	No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.	Okay.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.	What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
You got him.	Alice, I...
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?	Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?	Sure.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?	Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Okay. Thanks.	Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Hey.	Sit down a minute.
The police called us.	Yeah? what did they want?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.	But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Please tell me.	No.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.	The wife killer?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.	All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
We saw you that night, Pete.	You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?	Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
You just gonna let him go?	We'll get a tail put on him.
I wouldn't know how.	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
What is this, Rogoff?	I don't know yet.
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.	A headache?
No.	SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
That's it.	Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
What's your axe?	Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.	But my head...
What's that?	A videotape.
Does it say anything on the tape?	No, nothing.
Good book, huh?	Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I called, you know.	Called? When?
I thought you were getting me a drink?	Just a minute.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...	He's got some fucked up friends.
The heart, I guess.	I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 	No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 	Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Give that a try.	All right!
At sixty?	Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
You like pornos?	Pornos?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...	What?
Last time I saw you.	I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.	Whatiya mean?
No... I told you.	It was weird...
Why don't you like me?	I do like you, Sheila.
Sheila...	You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Hey... Sheila.	What's the BITCH'S name?!
All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.	Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.	She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Not even a radio?	It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
A what?	A paleontologist.
Sorry.	This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.	Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
I say, good morning, Lovey.	Good morning—
I see.	Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Yes.	Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.	Now you're irritating and absurd!
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.	Please don't call me Lovey.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.	All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.	I'm thinking.
No kidding?	Yes.
Yes.	Sounds like a stall to me.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.	Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!	Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!	They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.	So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!	I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and—	Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?	In a quandary.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?	Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!	Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Chalmers Bryant!	Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?	Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.	You have no disputes over women?
Who?	A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?	The only one.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.	It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.	No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.	Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?	Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.	I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Oh, thank you. Thank you!	Thank you.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.	How can we get in touch with them?
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!	Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!	Father Perrault is dead.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.	Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
Sondra Bizet.	Oh, the girl at the piano?
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.	I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.	Mine?
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.	Do you think this will come in my time?
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.	Right, Bob.
Bob, these are all that are left.	Come on! Quick! This way.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.	Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?	Yes.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?	Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?	What are you talking about?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.	Nothing about the porters yet?
Porters?	Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
What about the porters?	Porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—	George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?	You can't leave, George.
Why not? What's going to stop me?	You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.	So you think I'm mad?
I'd go mad!	George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!	You're wrong, George.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!	I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.	There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.	As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.	We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Was this your idea?	Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Yes.	You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Thank you.	Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm thirty.	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.	Bump?
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?	Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Would you like to wring my little neck?	I'd love it!
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?	I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
What do you want him to do?	I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
What is it?	Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Why, he's speaking English.	English!
How about you? Do you want to go?	Go? Where?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.	Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
EXCUSE ME–	Please don't go.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.	I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Thank you.	You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...	Cowan--
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?	It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.	I guess I lost:
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.	And Goodwill Toward Man?
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.	And if I say yes?
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?	I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?	I'd go with number three.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.	Kay...
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.	We wear black.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.	It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.	Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?	I taught kindergarten.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--	You don't know me at all.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.	If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?	I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Now what?	History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.	There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?	That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Jesus...	Get back in the car!
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--	I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--	That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...	Do his job.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.	Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!	Kay!?
After I got the shit beat out of me!	And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.	But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What the hell does that mean?	Actually... I don't know.
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...	Out of focus?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?	The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Nowhere.	Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?	It's... coming.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?	Nope.  Nothing at all.
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--	They're not my pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.	What if I don't?
Found it.	Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
This it?	Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Kay?  What's your 20?	Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.	What the hell is going on?
They're gone.	Dee?  What are you doing here?
Yeah?  What's up?	I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
He's here.	Anderton, leave.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?	Because I found out about her...
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.	Yeah --
Why?	Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
I put you away --	Yes, you did.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.	How do I find the --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.	I can't even stand up --
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?	No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Victim's a white female.	This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
That's an old one.  One of our first.	This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.	Show me just Agatha's data stream.
You the only sentry?	I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?	On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Tell me not to worry, John.	Don't worry, Lamar.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.	Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.	Yes, sir.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --	He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
Lara called me.	What?
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --	Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.	The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Go ahead.	Did he close the front door?
Confirm with trig and image.	Any ID on the shooter yet?
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.	Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
To them.	Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
You set me up...	I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!	Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
She was looking right at me.	It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.	Rufus.  She's a precog.
Stop --	Tell me how.
I scored a goal!	That's great.
Sean --	I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I forgive you.	Once I even told him I loved him.
I wanted to.	Good-bye, Dad...
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.	He's alive?
You're not gonna kill me?	No.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?	If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
You don't seem all that proud.	I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?	Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Why?	Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?	Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
You want to bring it down.	But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Where?	Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...	If... you have one.
-- and then walk out.	Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...	Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
Which one is that?	The female.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.	You look great.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."	We know why John was tagged.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?	Sean --
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?	The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Lamar, I found something.	What?
It's the same prevision.	Not quite.
So there is a way to fool the system?	Yes.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --	Shhh.  You know what I hear?
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.	Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.	Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.	We can stop him.
There a maid in this hotel?	I don't know, why?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?	They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.	Knott!
Raincheck?	Sure.  Raincheck.
This your work?	Yes.
Cream and sugar.	I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
I don't have any sugar either.	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.	It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
What was it then?	The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
You know I need to use you.	To what?  Trap him?
They've never been separated before.	What does he want with a precog?
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.	What are you talking about?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.	You're Bobby, right?
Yeah.	Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?	We have snifters
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.	What's 'incidentals?'
Yes, sir.	Is it a good room?
Not on me, sir.	Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Thank you very much, sir.	So?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.	What if I gave you forty?
So, wait, you're from where?	Manhattan.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...	Somebody's getting comfortable.
Is he cute?	He's okay.
Should I fuck him?	I don't know. Do whatever you want.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.	Bullshit.
I don't know.	Mommy's not home?
Oh, please.	If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.	Who's watching the baby?
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.	They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
No coke tonight.  Right?	Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!	Shhh. He'll hear you.
I never promised you anything.	How could you let her see this?
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.	Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
Take her.	What'd you say?
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?	I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
What's your record at?	5-5-1.
What's his name?	Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
When's it going down?	Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?	This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
How so?	He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
A million. Easy.	She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.	That's why they call it the smart money.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?	Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I got a way we make everybody happy.	Yeah.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.	Ruiz knows about this?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.	He'll work it off.
Yeah. Sure.	How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...	Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Yes.	What is it?
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.	I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.	Where's the drop?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.	Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Where is the Soho Grand?	Soho.
I can wait around if you want.	No. That's cool, man.
Spa?	Yeah.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?	Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
How am I being shitty?	Don't be shitty.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?	I got no idea.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.	Then why do you try to get in?
I think we might.	He didn't say we need guns.
I gotta pick up the baby.	Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
How'd you unlock my phone?	I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?	See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.	What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.	Nah, don't bother --
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.	You sure?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?	Yeah, I guess.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.	But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Oh really. Why's that?	We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.	Well, I don't want to walk.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?	You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
You know this guy?	His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...	What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You happy?	About what?
You fucking nuts?	Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You gonna shank him in the shower?	Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Let's check out the penguins.	The what?
We need guns.	We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.	I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
All the more reason.	You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Eighty five.	What happened to the fifteen hundred?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.	I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
I'm sorry...	This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?	And you grew up in Manhattan?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.	That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Where's the surprise?	You want your surprise?
You want to come splash around.	I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?	How is it you're good? You on a list?
What's up, man.	S'up.
Yes?	Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?	Yes.
Where's Spa.	Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.	Why? What I say bad?
Stop.	I'll tell him someone else told me.
Ow, shit...	Watch it...
No shit?	Does anyone want another?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?	I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Coke?	I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...	Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Here they are, then.	How's it going?
Come, now. You just got here.	That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.	No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
Good morning.	You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?	We're square.
Yes. You're going to New York.	And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You want... Why are you picking on me?	Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
No. I'll take a strega.	What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
So, we're talking money laundering...	Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Scotland.	Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
I'll get it.	Who's up for a night on the town.
What they call you?	Red, and I ain't no punk.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.	Heard where?
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?	My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.	Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?	I'll take your goddam bet.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?	You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.	I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?	I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
What did you give it to me for then?	'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
You ain't lying.	When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?	I ain't said I'm ashamed.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.	Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Where am I gonna start?	Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --	Then the devil is white.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.	I sure met some.
You are now Benjamin 2X.	All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.	Next week, Brother Minister.
Make it plain.	And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.	Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
I see your point.	So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.	I can handle it.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.	Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.	What have you set your mind to?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?	We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."	There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?	Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.	Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.	Shhh!
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.	Dear heart, I love you.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?	Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Brother Earl.	Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Let's cancel.	Is my family here yet?
Now just a moment, just a moment --	But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?	Please, go ahead.
If you want to tell me.	Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Are you Elijah's pimp?	What?
'Bout every other night, Red.	With him?
I mean it's late, baby.	I know where you're going.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.	All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.	All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Did you hear me?!	You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Another one?	How long has this been going on?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.	What does Sidney say?
You evil this morning.	What's your story, baby?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?	Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.	Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.	Well, bitch you move too slow.
You had the number.	Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.	Shorty, this is Laura.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.	The hell you are.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?	I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.	How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.	What can you do?
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.	So what about him?
Who the hell are they?	Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.	He told you that?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.	Allah will provide.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.	Am I a suspect?
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.	What do you want?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.	Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[Where are you coming from?]	[South America.]
[Senor?]	[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.	I show, you give me the information?
[Daniel.]	[Daniel what?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]	[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]	[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I don't know, I swear.]	[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]	[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]	[How do I recognize him.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]	[I want you.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]	[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[What do you mean?]	[Her life for your life.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]	[And?]
[And I had my men ready.]	[You stole the drop.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]	[Don't lie to me!]
And what if amateurs try it?	I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?	Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
What are you doing here?	I came to visit you.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.	A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.	You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Creasy?	Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.	Yes or no?
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?	Time will tell.
We're taking a different way home.	That's right.
Not at all?	No.
You're fast.	Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Do you think he'll come back?	Maybe. Did you hear him?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?	It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
Why do you ask?	It was in a book at school. Concubine.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?	No, that was in Columbia.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?	No.
Could I ask you a question?	Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.	That's not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?	Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.	The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.	You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?	Because...  I was already dead.
Creasy... Wait.	Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.	Her beauty fucks with your mind.
For an American she understands this country very well.	She understands men.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.	We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Yes, mom?	This is Mr. Creasy.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]	[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[I know this. Your point?]	[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]	[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]	[And left three more dead men.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]	[I should start going for your tits first.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.	You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.	This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.	I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...	She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...	All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Hey, Herbie...	What?
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?	Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?	I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.	Yeah, sure.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.	Where?
Who you gonna call?	I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Are you kidding?	Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.	I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.	We just talked.
Who told you that?	Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I don't think I remember him.	Well, he died. You know who else died?
Ufa!	I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Ah?	You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.	They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.	This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.	I'm having a very good time, too.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.	You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.	Thank you.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.	Yes, I know.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.	I don't.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.	I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.	Actually, I don't make friends easily.
This is the kitchen.	Yes, I know.
Marty...	I just wanna kiss, that's all.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.	I'll wait for your call.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?	Nothing.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.	How do you do?
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.	It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?	Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?	I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
You say something?	Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
What?	I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?	Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...	Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.	Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?	Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?	Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.	Sure.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.	She didn't look Italian to me.
So these two girls come over to the bar...	Hey, Ang'...
...and they sit down right next to me...	You want a beer, Ang'?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...	Hiya, Ralph...
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.	Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
Sure.	You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."	The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...	Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.	I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.	Sure, sure.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...	Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Tommy!	I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?	Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Tommy...	I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?	Waddaya talking about?!!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!	I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.	What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.	Never this close.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.	Just one for a start.
You boys'll have to go to work early.	You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
What are you going to do with him?	Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Stop him! Stop that man!	Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?	Home.
Don't you use olives?	Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.	Pour one for Painless.
Y'all mind the store.	Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Us. Lead us not into...	...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?	What's there to do? You found the sliver.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.	Duke Forrest.
Make it yourself, or is it real?	Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.	That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.	Except we forgot one other small thing.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.	This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.	You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
When will he be able to write?	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.	You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?	I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?	All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Look at the size of those two beasts.	I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.	And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
I was just asking...	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.	A football game?
Gimme three.	At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.	I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Radar!	All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
What for?	We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.	Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?	If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.	As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.	So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.	Radar!
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.	Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?	They're coming.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.	We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.	Not necessarily.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?	Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
The bastards outconned us.	I think we could still have a chance.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?	No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.	It isn't always this rough?
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.	Ayuh.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.	That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.	Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?	It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You're asking for somebody else?	It happens to be a matter of life and death.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.	I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!	Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
What's the story?	Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's wrong with him?	Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.	That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
I have not understood what you means.	That. It's out of the act.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.	Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?	Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
The blonde dish.	If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.	That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.	There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?	You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
What's going on? Who started this?	You mean who hit who?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.	I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
O'Reilly!	Yes, sir?
Sir?	Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.	Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?	Oh, get out of here!
Splendid, sir. No problems.	Morning, Captain.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.	The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Yeah?	It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?	No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.	But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Did you get it, too?	Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?	Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.	With all of it?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.	Against what?
Yes!	Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
Who?	John Doe, the one in the speech.
Oh. Yeah.	You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello, John.	Hello.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—	John Doe Clubs? What for?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.	Me?
Can I help you pack?	No, thank you.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?	I guess so. Then what happened?
Did you write this?	Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
How much money do you get?	Thirty dollars.
Thank you very much for everything.	And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Oh!	Go ahead, open it, open it.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.	Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?	Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.	Wait a minute . . .
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.	Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.	It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.	There is no letter.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!	In what man!
John Doe.	What John Doe?
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.	So?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?	Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Looks all right—	He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
That's our man. He's made to order.	I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.	Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.	I got it all ready. Here.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!	If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
What's the idea?	No, no, no. Now that's too much!
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?	Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Had any schooling?	Yeah, a little.
Baseball?	Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Who's got him?	The heelots!
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."	Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!	Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?	You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.	I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.	You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.	What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Join the John Doe Club.	John Doe Club?
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?	Yeah, you bet!
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.	How?
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!	Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?	No, I didn't.
How about family? Got any family?	No.
That's a lie!	It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
That's got nothing to do with it!	Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Oh!	Did you want to see her about something important?
What do you mean, too bad?	Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?	Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!	Shh!
No -- you can't do that.	You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.	"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Where's the stereo?	Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
What's the line?	It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.	I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.	Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Who's controlling your mind?	Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
This has nothing to do with Walter.	They want Walter dead!
Where's the car?	I need to get something straight first.
Who are you again?	Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...	...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
For now that's all.	You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Open your shirt.	I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
You ever been in a hostage situation?	Only at the very end.
What's the point of this?	A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
You'd never been out of New York?	Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?	I don't gamble.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.	Explain how that works.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.	I think I can handle that one.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.	I'm not good at lying.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.	Okay, stop.
The 6 horse is last.	That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?	To run late!
And what about the ones you don't save?	You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?	You've got to decide that for yourself.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.	You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I worship you.	You worship yourself.
That a new picture?	About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.	What do you want from me?
It's already started.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.	Yeah that's it.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.	Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
Yeah?	...Let me just show you.
Hmm?	Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.	A deeper level?
Stay up there, Girl...	Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.	Define concern.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.	Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.	Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.	What happened to your Trans Am?
Roper...	Who's running it!
What do you need?	I need to take back what's mine.
It's okay.	Okay...
Why?	To live forever.
What's happening?	Nothing, go back to sleep.
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.	Not my problem.
Divinity?	Yes.
The new world.	It's not real.
How long 'till we can eject?	We're going to have to reconfigure.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.	Go!
Try harder.	Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
A hotel?	It's not used for anything.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?	Good question.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.	Try harder.
Someone you have to get back to?	No.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --	-- Katie.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.	Who are you?!
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.	Her?
But I don't know anything about programming.	Once they digitized you, they added it.
And it meant something.	Yes.
I'm sorry.	Sorry?!
It was just there.	There?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.	Checking connection.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --	-- Waiter.
Connect to public access.	Access established.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.	If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
I can hardly walk...	I've never been this sore in my life.
Release the power WITH the power.	What does that mean?!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!	I am the crane, agile and sublime!
That's the only way to the Monolith...	We can take these guys!
Here you go!  No pushing!	There's enough for everybody!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.	You want me to place a few calls?
But boss, what about their parents?	Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Anybody see them?	Activating Power Scope!
How the heck?!...	What's going on?!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.	And I ain't no nigger either!
You own a hotel, sir?	The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
The goddamned bastards.	Tell me about it.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".	Poor, yeah.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.	Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?	You scare me, Charlie.
Four-twenty-eight.	What's that divided four ways?
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.	You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?	He was around...
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?	If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
The deal's too good, Frankie	What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
Something came up.	I needed to see you again.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?	It's a mask.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.	As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?	I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.	And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
We'll figure out something.	I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Like Don Maranzano.	And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.	Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.	They don't give a shit about us!
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.	Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!	Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.	Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.	Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I'm glad ya come.	What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.	He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?	You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Where we headed?	Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.	That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
So tell me when I ain't done it.	How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.	Not if they all die at once.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.	But that's an hour's drive.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.	Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.	I must know more of you, my son.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.	Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.	Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
We combine everything. You are my second in command.	What about the share.
The terms will be mine.	The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.	What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.	We can operate around these guys.
Strategy.	Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.	Shuddup.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.	I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.	Guess I'm just lucky.
Yes?	I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.	That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.	Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?	Yeah...before your time.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?	Switch hands.
What's the maximum safe dose?	Most we've ever used is half a CC.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.	Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.	Sad commentary, huh?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.	<u>Why</u>??
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.	Bend over?
DEATH!!	I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Death! Thank you!	Thank me next time you see me.
At the moment, yes.	Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...	Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...	Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Oh my God...you're proposing?	My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Holy shit.	He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.	What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Uh huh. And?	Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!	But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...	Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Bitchin' good cake.	Stu, are you...feeling okay?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!	It looks so...<u>new</u>.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.	Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this...
Stu?	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!	Give me a date, Doctor.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.	Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.	I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.	Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?	Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??	Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?	Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Stu...LOOK!	What?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.	Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.	Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.	What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?	Uh-huh?
You know ...  ... whoops!	Mother!
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.	Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?	Oh, I hope so, dear.
He's an organic farmer.	Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Where to?	Are you sure you got my bag in?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?	Moscow.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?	Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.	Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--	Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.	Thanks very much, sonny--
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!	It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?	I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.	Never.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?	I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
But it *isn't*?	It couldn't be.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.	Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.	Would you settle for a husband?
Ah. One of the supporting characters.	Who?
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.	What do I play?
You play--left field.	Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--	I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.	And to Don Quixote!
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--	Waiter!
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--	Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?	I apologize.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?	Have *you*?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)	Well, let's get going.
You know, we're getting married.	Take me home, Diz.
Taylor, my dear.	Can't that wait, Hubert?
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!	Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.	How do you feel, champ?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--	*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.	Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
What!	Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--	Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.	The--head?
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.	I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?	Is *what* getting me down?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.	What stuff?
A pet shop?	Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--	Look! There it is!
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.	H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
Will the Senator yield?	For a question!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?	For one week!
Will the Senator yield for a question?	I yield.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.	You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?	No.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--	What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.	Here--where are you running off to?
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--	Good as new! It's quite all right--
Mr. President--	I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Will the Senator--	I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Yes, Ma?	Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--	What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
What's your name?	J-Jefferson Smith.
Whose statue is that?	I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!	You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--	With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
We're going right ahead with--*what*?	Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?	I know--but you--you're going to help.
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.	Why?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?	We're over in the House.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?	Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
It hasn't been easy, has it?	No complaints.
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--	I don't see where we are *with* it.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?	Go right ahead.
Abigail.	No!
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?	Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?	Second drawer.
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.	Thanks a lot.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.	*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!	Are you drunk?
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--	That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 	Wait--
Ah! That's more like it! What?	Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?	The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--	How are the pigeons?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.	Well! You don't say!
Order, gentlemen!	Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--	Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Ax?	A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!	Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
I know that.	Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.	Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--	Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!	Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!	Go away, Nosey.
That's right.	Oh, now--that won't do--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--	I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
What do you want, Senator?	Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.	Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Jim!	Just a minute, Joe!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--	It's crucifying him--!
His first 'whiff'!	Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Father--oh.	Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.	What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Will the Senator yield?	Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !	Order!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?	Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.	Page boys!
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.	Who are you?
Good morning.	Morning, neighbors. Morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?	Deeds?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.	Sometimes he whistles.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.	Never can tell what he's going to do.
Are you married?	Yes, sir.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?	Yes!
Oh, thank you!	Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.	What happened?
Feel better now?	Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.	Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.	Yes.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.	Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
The drums. He taught me to play some.	He did?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.	A girl?
Hello, Mary?	Oh, hello darling.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.	Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
The guy's balmy.	Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
You're a fool, Babe.	I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Just a minute. No, you don't.	We're not going out tonight.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!	It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!	I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?	Yes.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?	I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
That's the rub.	Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Ow! My foot's asleep!	Come on - let's go!
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.	But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—	Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, but you said—	I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.	They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
I wish you luck, sir.	Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Thank heaven.	Better wire him right away, John.
Nuisance value?	They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Must we have the echo?	Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.	Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.	See you later, kid.
Look!	What?
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—	Yeah?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?	Yes.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?	Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.	Huh?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?	That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?	Nah.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.	Huh?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]	Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.	Only common sense.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?	Entertainment?
What do you think bodyguards are for?	What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Sometimes it's the only solution.	Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—	Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?	They can have the Estate.
Now, where were we?	You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.	Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?	What kind of wife did you say she was?
Yes, sir.	That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?	You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
No - I don't want it, thank you.	Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.	Take the stand!
Proceed.	Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?	Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.	Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?	No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Proceed.	Thank you, Your Honor.
Uh-huh.	I'm a writer myself, you know.
Uh-huh.	I write poetry.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?	Binge?
Who are they?	I don't know.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?	You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?	Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.	Thank you so much. Good night.
Tails tonight, sir?	What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
What do you think you're doing?	Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.	Every man to his taste, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?	Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.	Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.	Who?
Hey, did you hear that?	What, sir?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.	How did they threaten you?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --	Take your time.
You can go out there if you like...	"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Dr. Mumford.	Mr. Cook.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...	Uh-huh.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?	No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?	Were you supposed to have a session?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.	A friend?
Interesting approach. What was his name?	Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Why not?	Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --	Good, then go.
You find it distasteful, don't you?	It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.	What?!
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.	What exactly is it supposed to do?
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?	My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?	Nope.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."	I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?	A little.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.	I'm sorry, your honor.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?	No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.	Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
What do you want to know?	You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.	Where am I supposed to eat?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.	It's a pleasure to meet you.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.	Okay.
Hello, Lionel.	You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
I just got my license two weeks ago.	You're good.
What's happening here?	We're going for a walk.
Ph.D., psychologist.	Oh... not a real doctor.
What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.
Finally, some common sense...	What do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.	No, I really don't.
Well... you see, the problem is --	-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Just who is here, can you tell me?	Could I see Sofie, please?
When did you start to feel this way?	About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Mom's such a cutie.	People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?	Is she against you getting help?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.	You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
You're doing great.	I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
It doesn't matter. Go on.	Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
That was really bad, wasn't it?	Disgusting.
Is that when you split up?	No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.	I don't know if --
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.	Of course.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.	You're upset.
Is it something you've heard about me?	No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.	Okay...
You got off easy.	Will you wait for me?
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.	What do you mean, "in no time"?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.	It's a big part of the show.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?	It's my bit for the community.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.	You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.	True. Should we stop them?
I've got three big ones.	I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.	You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?	Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.	Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.	Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.	Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.	Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.	Really?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.	Holy shit!
"Get to know your therapist."	You were messed up, man.
And the drugs?	Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
I know it starts with a birth certificate...	All new people start with that...
And a birth certificate is enough?	Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
Psych major?	English Lit.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?	Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?	There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?	Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.	Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.	Relax, I got him.
And what ritual would that be?	The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And how does one do that?	By reading the Book Of The Dead.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!	None of the above, thank you.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.	Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?	It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?	Intestines.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.	Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --	-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.	No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?	Correct, And that's when --
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!	For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Two hundred pounds.	Proceed!
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.	Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No?	No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?	Want to know?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.	Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.	Oh that's comforting.
For what?	We're about to be shown the way.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.	What are those mirrors for?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.	Preparation for what?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.	Who was talking about what?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.	How?
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.	No you're not.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.	That bad huh?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.	The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.	Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.	We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
It's everybody's problem!	Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
That's what I am to you? A contract?	You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
I think you were jealous	Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got it!	Got what?
Don't do it, Evelyn.	I have no choice.
Jonathan?	Yes?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?	He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?	After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?	What's it look like!?
That thing gives me the creeps.	Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Tough break.	Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.	Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.	And then he'll be coming after Evy.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?	He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.	I know you did.
I knew you'd know.	I know you knew I'd know.
Um-hmm.	Except for one little thing.
Where are you going?	Head hunting.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?	Fantasizing... about you.
Our guests are waiting.	I'll be down in a jiffy.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.	I'm his daughter.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.	Really?
We didn't think this through very well.	My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Much less go outside.	Then Captain Amazing appeared.
We could really use some coffee --	And some sandwiches --
Hey, do I look like a Man?	Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.	He was cute though.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?	I thought you'd never ask.
How's your dad?	He's dead.
He'll never make it.	Think positive.
Have you considered my offer?	You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".	Really?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.	It's home.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...	What have they got that we ain't got?
I'm going inside.	What are you talking about?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.	Good or evil, what's the difference?
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.	My heart died a long time ago.
I'm liking this.	I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
This place is built like a fortress.	Because that's what it is.
GET MAD!	But I just don't feel it.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!	There's a vague similarity.
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.	So you're chicken?
Maybe she's right.	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
The Obliterators!	The Eradicators!
Yes, Obie-wan.	Hey... he's gone.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?	We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
So what can I get you?	Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
It's on the television.	Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
I use it... to fight evil.	Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
This is bad.	Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.	This looks like a job for Superman --
Don't crunch the leaves.	Sorry.
Be a Mohican.	Shut up.
Do we have to?	I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
And there's the Sphinx.	The who?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?	The bazookas?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.	Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
We've got lift off!	May the forks be with us!
Where am I going?	Through there!
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.	I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.	You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.	For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.	Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
Proceed.	If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?	Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
There are none here.	Where are they?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.	Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.	What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.	Let me see it.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.	Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?	Yes, sir.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.	Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Yes, sir?	A glass of champagne, please.
I haven't been there for three years.	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
How did it spread so quickly?	It is the work of incendiaries.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.	Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
I have met her.  What is your business with me?	I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.	I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.	My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Oh...?	I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.	Yes, I am, sir.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.	Are you staying with a friend, sir?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.	Is it a nice warm room, sir?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.	My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?	No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
And now?	Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Do you expect me to believe that?	Yes.
Were they pretty?	Yes.
Were any of them married?	Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.	All right -- I promise.
Yes -- what is it?	Open the door.  It's me.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.	What are you doing in there?
Yes!!	Five minutes.
But you will not... be safe...	Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.	I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?	He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.	What are you talking about?
You wrote it.	I couldn't face telling you.
You could hear them?	Yes.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?	I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.	And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.	Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
And, where did you see my portrait?	Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.	Of course, my dear.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?	You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.	I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Has Alexander agreed to this?	Yes, he has.
What I am talking about is moderation.	What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.	He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.	You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.	Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.	From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."	Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.	A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.	You paid cash?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.	Good.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.	Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?	Yup.
Where you going?	Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Great moves, Day-Day.	What happen?
What you mean talk to her?	You know what he mean, dude.
Me neither.	It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.	Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Nobody!	If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Who is that?	Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?	Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!	I know, be still.
What?	Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?	I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
$247.	Okay, plan B.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.	I don't.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.	Ain't no windows in here.
It works.	Still gonna smell it.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?	Out the door and to the left.
Alright, Roach, see you around.	Sorry about today, man.
How you know?  It could be anything.	I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
You go first.	Naw, you go first.
You go first.	No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.	I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Karla.	Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
You want us to give you a ride?	I don't know.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.	Why didn't she put'em out?
Next time, page me first.	Okay.
Delivery!	Hold on.
What's the matter?	I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.	Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.	Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
That the big one, huh?	You damn right that's the big one.
What was that?	You don't wanna know.
Are they still out there?	Negative...they vamped.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.	I know.
Hey.	Ya'll live around here?
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?	He's a boy, dude.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.	Thanks for the help.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.	Call me.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.	20 minutes?
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.	I know.  I'm sorry.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?	What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Rancho Cucamonga?	Yeah.
Just do it.	I don't know the number.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.	Good, let's get out.
Hey, how you get out of here.	I don't know.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?	I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.	Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
My back.	What's the matter?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.	Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Elroy, what happen?	I threw my back, again.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.	It's an important speech.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.	What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.	What happened here?
I appreciate that.	One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.	That's...a comfort to hear.
I remember you...in the elevator.	That's right.
For what?	For not believing you.
Good luck.	Same to you.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...	You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.	You wouldn't...
Yes, yes, I understand.	Good.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.	Where did you get these? Who are you?
Are you 'fucking with me!?	The gun...
He's dead?	That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
Come back.	How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Again.	No, please...
I talk to her or you can forget about it.	Don't you threaten me.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?	I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?	No way.
Lynn!	I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I have to do something.	What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
It's a twenty.	Keep it.
You remember me?	I remember. The big tipper.
Please...	Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Cover your mouth.	What?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?	That's right.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?	It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?	Everybody does?
I'm not a baby.	You're a big girl, huh?
I've got something for you.	A surprise?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.	Keep your eyes peeled.
Come Back.	Yeah.
Put her on.	What gives?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.	Yes, Dad.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."	I will guard Pearl with my life...
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...	When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Leavin', boy?	Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?	Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!	Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?	Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.	About what!
What's wrong, Mother?	Sshhh! He's in there.
Who?	Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?	A man of the Cloth?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.	You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Pearl dotes on him.	The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.	Amen.
I tried to save her.	I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!	Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
John...	Sshhh...
Where's Mom?	She's gone to Moundsville.
Someone is after us, Pearl.	I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
I'm hungry, John.	We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!	That's Daddy!
Don't you hurt her!	Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Story, honey? Why, what story?	About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.	He ain't my Dad.
I'll see to Pearl.	I'll make coffee.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.	Is that all?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --	You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Tell me what, boy?	Nothin'!
What are you doing, boy?	Getting Pearl to bed. I --
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --	NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
You don't reckon I'd leave you.	Don't you believe me?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!	You could save him, little bird.
Now it's your turn.	What secret shall I tell?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.	Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
John's bad.	Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?	Can I have this?
The first night?	Our honeymoon.
What do you figure to do?	Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.	He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Get up, Willa.	Harry, what --
What's wrong, John?	Didn't you hear me, boy?
He never asked me for nothin'.	He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?	Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
How can you tell?	R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Oh my god, oh my god...	Get the kit!
Worked like a charm.	Jesus.
You okay?	Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Guess I did.	Haven't slept, have you?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?	No.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?	They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
What happens if they don't do that?	I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Hello?	Hi.
Bring him out of what?	My dream.
How you plan to do that?	Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
You crazy? Hit him with what?	You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Hello Nancy.	Hi daddy. I know what happened.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.	Nan, I --
Did you sleep?	I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.	I won't.
What?	You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
I must be going nuts...	Nancy?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.	But that's just not reality, Nancy!
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.	Put that damned thing down!
Feeling better?	They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?	He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.	Nobody's gonna kill you.
No more fights?	No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade.	Have you any money?
Aren't you late?	No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?	A few friends... just a little dinner party.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?	Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.	You should be more careful, Anna.
An evening gown.	Evening gown?
Yes.	Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....	And there?
You feel it, though.	Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You want this?	Just for the honeymoon.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?	I don't want to go to Siberia.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.	And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.	No, that's bad management.
Which lawyer?	You didn't get legal advice?
Comrade Buljanoff...	Yes, Comrade?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.	Don't worry... there will be enough.
It is high time you got out of Russia.	I must be stern with you.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.	Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
All you have to do is say "open sesame."	I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The former Duchess!	In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Good evening, Gaston.	Good evening, Monsieur.
Your breakfast, monsieur.	I don't feel like any breakfast.
I guess it is eight forty-two.	You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?	No, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.	Are they indeed? Thank you.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?	Yes.
Good evening, Your Highness.	Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.	Count d'Algout...
Is this satisfactory?	Thank you, Louis.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.	While you eat, you look at the view.
Let's do that.	It's a real Paris reunion.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 	...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
If you want to see us you must come later.	I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
And if we have to go to Siberia...	I'll send you a muff.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?	No, no.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?	A cow?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.	Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.	Brave... that's right.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...	Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."	You mean you are deserting Russia?
Yes, monsieur?	Just looking around.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?	Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...	That's even better.
We may have a chance.	Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.	Yes, Comrade.
If there is anything we can do for you...	No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...	Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.	Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Don't hold that against me... please!	Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Private.	There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.	I think so too.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...	You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!	Why should I take a chance?
You, please.	Me?
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Can I help you?	You might hold this for me.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?	I don't have to but I find it natural.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.	And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Then you don't want me to go there.	Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.	He takes good care of that.
I will start with you.	That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Don't do it, please.	I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!	I don't like your following me.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?	But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Will you smile?	Why?
On which boat?	Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?	No.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?	Yes.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...	Ninotchka, you're jealous.
How do you do?	And General Savitzky.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.	A funny story?
Go on.	No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Comrades! Comrades!	Darling, darling... please!
Not white, darling.	All right, we'll make it red.
And we won't stretch up our arms...	No! No!
...and we won't clench our fist...	No! No!
Would that make you any happier?	Much happier.
No music.	No, no music.
Hello, Leon!	Good morning, Swana.
Did you win?	We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?	I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
You haven't seen her yet?	No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.	That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?	You can't imagine.
Thank you.	Is this your new dress suit?
Yes, Swana, you did.	It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Yes, Swana.	Am I interrupting?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?	No thanks, Swana.
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?	I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Hello, Leon darling!	Hello.
Now, please, Swana.	Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.	We have nothing to discuss.
You leave me no choice.	Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?	No.
You want me to go to Constantinople?	Yes... leaving immediately.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.	That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
It's just a place for workmen.	Where is it?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...	What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...	They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
We'll see about that ...	He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
How much do you need?	Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --	I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?	Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.	I'll bet he would.
Is it?	In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
To protect his people.	I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.	It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.	The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.	Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?	Mitchell?
McCord? ...	Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 	Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
We can't touch Hoover --	I thought the gloves were off.
The country's loving it.	The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.	He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!	Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...	Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.	So?
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.	There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.	That's right ...
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.	Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Well, why not?	Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.	You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!	The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Just do what I say, Bob.	Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.	The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.	How is this national security?
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...	He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...	He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?	Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.	Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.	Jesus!
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?	No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?	Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
What'd he say?	What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
What'd you say?	I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Mom expects great things from you ...	Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.	My friends call me "Mister President."
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...	Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...	Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Not if I give you all the cards ...	I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.	Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.	Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
No.	Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Ummm...	If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?	Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.	Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?	No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
Who we working for?	A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Where'd you find him?	Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?	I won't tell him if you won't.
Mein Kampf?	"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
So, what's this about, Dick?	It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.	Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.	I beg your pardon --
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...	But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.	Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?	Yes, Mr. President.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.	I was the lesser of two evils.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.	Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Uh, wait ...	You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Jesus Christ!	One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.	You're shittin' me.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...	Ernie Davis.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?	Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...	Elvis I like, too.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...	Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...	There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
We got the press this time!	And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.	What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?	Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.	Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.	Sir?
We lost ...	I know ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.	What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Amen to that.	It's over, Dick.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?	I want a divorce.
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?
Were you planning to tell me?	We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.	Can I just ask for one thing?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.	Yes, it's been a long time ...
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.	Sometimes I think that's what you want.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...	But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Yes.	When?
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?	You.  What' you're doing --
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...	You're drunk!
Won or lost?	Lost.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.	To what?
What?	The "crises"?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."	Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
How'd you know I was here.	Who else'd be in your truck.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?	What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
How many a those things you got now?	Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
What would you a done if he'd been released?	I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.	Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?	I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Nineteen zero and nine.	No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.	No ID in her room?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.	It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.	I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Yes ma'am?	If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
...You ride Winston.	You sure?
That's the boy.	You figure him for a dope runner?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.	I'm ahead of you there.
How's that, Sheriff?	Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yessir.	My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
It ain't even three years we been married.	Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I put it in, Mama.	Well I didn't see it.
Did you buy that gun?	No. I found it.
What'd you give for that thing?	You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Llewelyn.	Yeah.
So... for how long do we have to...	Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Llewelyn --	C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Why all the way to Del Rio?	I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
You can't afford one?	Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Promise?	Yes I do.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.	Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Mama's gonna raise hell.	Uh-huh.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.	You should be used to that.
Llewelyn?	Hey.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?	What makes you say that?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?	You mean the nature of this conversation?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?	Where does he work?
I can't say.	Where does he work?
Huh? What is...	I need you to step out of the car, sir.
...You getting anything on this?	Not a bleep.
Airport.	Well -- where ya goin'?
Who is this.	You know who it is.
...I know where you are.	Yeah? Where am I?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?	Yeah. I know where you're going.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?	No. Do you?
What way would that be?	I seen you was from Dallas.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?	I didn't mean nothin' by it.
...Will there be somethin' else?	I don't know. Will there?
Is somethin' wrong?	With what?
With anything?	Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?	Sir?
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?	Sir?
Yes.	For what?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.	I didn't put nothin' up.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.	Uh-huh. Double ought.
What kind of tent?	The kind with the most poles.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?	No sir, it's unusual.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.	What room?
November the 28th, last year.	You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.	Yessir. I understand that.
...I'm wondering...	Yes?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.	Another additional.
Waitin' for my wife.	Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Half.	What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.	Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
It's called a transponder.	I know what it is. He won't find me again.
What did you do?	I'm a welder.
Cast iron?	Yes.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.	He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
The heroin. You don't have it.	No I don't have it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.	If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.	He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
Are you in the service?	No sir. I'm a veteran.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?	Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?	BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?	No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
It wasn't a woman.	Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?	They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.	Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?	...to see you.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.	"Thirty-two?"
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.	Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...	I better go check on them.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.	...what're you saying?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?	I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?	Umm... yes. Back home.
The LeSabre!	Maroon.  I stole it.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!	Yeah, me too.
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.	Do what?
I gotta go.	Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?	I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.	You knew Del?!
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...	...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...	Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!	Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Thanks...	...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.	I ran back in to get the phone.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...	Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...	Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!	Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!	Ahh, look, right now's not very...
What's the matter here?	I begged him to let me put that on!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.	Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Where you headed, Betty?	Los Angeles, California.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.	Did you love it?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...	Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
How did you know?	What's his real name?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --	No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?	Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.	Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!	You said in L.A., anything goes.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!	Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Why'd you help me in the first place?	I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.	Fine.
What are those for?	Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
You should have a little faith in people.	Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.	I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.	No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Really. And where was that, old man?	Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.	You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.	If we're for real?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.	I don't follow...
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.	...and put them in your mouth.
That's right.	Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That is so right.	Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.	So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?	IT SURE IS!!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.	He told us it's in the Buick.
We can live with that.	I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?	We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?	Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.	I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...	I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!	It just didn't fit her profile...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?	...who doesn't?
Really?	You better believe it.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...	I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.	We know that...
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!	No! Let me try this!
Yeah? The sport utility?	Uh-huh.
Because it ain't natural, young man.	What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.	Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
No... before that.	Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.	I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.	No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -	Waitaminute -
Waitaminute -	You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?	You mis'able little sneak thief...
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?	Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
...Pete?	Do not seek the treasure!
How'd he know about the treasure?	Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!	I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!	Where's Tommy?
Whuhh...	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!	Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!	Okay, Everett.
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...	Everett, my beard itches.
A miracle! It was a miracle!	Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!	Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Pullin' ah pants down...	Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Helluva idea.	Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.	Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.	Now Penny, stop that!
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?	I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!	Don't I know it.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.	Well that hardly sounds like you...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...	...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Fact of the matter - there never was!	But... but...
Pete... I do apologize.	Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!	Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.	Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!	Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?	How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!	We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Mama said you was hit by a train!	Blooey!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.	Great.
Hi, Byron.	Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.	Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Who gave you this idea?	Nobody. It just came to me.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.	You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?	From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Who's that?	Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Great ass.	Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...	I never said any of that!
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!	Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?	No, sir!
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.	Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?	Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.	It's important, sir!
Hi, son.	How're you doing, Sarge?
What did you call me?	Pardon?
What did you call me, Mayo?	Zack, don't!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.	But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Yes I do!	Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Vietnam?	Yeah.
Something tells me you've been here before.	Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?	Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
How late?	What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?	What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?	Let's just wait and see what happens.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...	That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.	We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?	Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.	Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
That was you guys, huh?	Come on. Let's go dance.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?	Great.
Lynette, where's Sid?	Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.	He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.	Where'd you learn to fight like that?
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.	Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You stayed after all.	Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?	I've never had a girl.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?	When I'm good and ready.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.	No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?	Twenty-two years ago.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.	I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?	I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I'd like to come with you.	Why?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.	I can't risk it.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.	Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.	He said he grew up poor?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.	Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Hey, you guys still awake?	Yeah.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.	That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.	I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.	I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.	Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?	No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Do you know that for sure?	It's mine.
No problem.	I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
There is not one thing funny here.	Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
He said open it.	Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Th --	Okay, okay!  Okay.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!	FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Fuck.	I know.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?	You're an idiot.
Where did you get this clown?	I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.	Yeah.  Kidnapping.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.	Shut up and let me think.
Cell phone.	Shit!
I mean it!	Adios.
Yeah?	Everything okay?
Can we come in?	Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.	No ball, kid.
Watch your mouth.	It's okay, Raoul.
Cut it back a little bit.	No fucking way.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.	If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
We're leaving.	The hell we are.
Suit yourself.	Nobody leaves.
Makes me nervous.	Why?
Ever read any Poe?	I don't think so, but I love her album.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?	Open the door.
Shoulda got an apartment.	Well, I know that now.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.	The crowd goes wild.
I heard you.	Feel okay?
We're never getting out of here.	Shhh...
Call Dad!	On it!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."	He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.	I'm sorry.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?	I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.	What if I keep dropping?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...	What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
Uhh... I with it sister but...	But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Those ain't cops.	And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Alma I told you to...	Fuck that, we've got company...
No...	You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.	Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?	What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...	That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?	You know it brother.
You got to sit on Eldridge...	Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Get out of the car.	What's with you?
What are you crazy?	Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Inspector Brimmer	Yeah, it's me.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...	I don't know. Look around man.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.	Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?	It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Now hold on Rodgers...	Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...	Are you finished?
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.	Jesus...
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.	...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.	Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
C'mon let's...	No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
Yeah man, but where's Judge?	You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?	I'm down.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?	Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...	They were empty...
What's the pig's name?	Brimmer.
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.	Yeah.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.	You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.	If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.	Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.	What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?	Just the legit shit.
You got something on your mind... "brother."	Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Fuck is up?!	Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.	Bullshit...
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?	No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?	All of the above, man...  And then some.
My Mom's at that.	Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...	What?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.	Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yeah... cop hit me...	I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.	Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
You believe that?	I don't know. I really don't.
Congratulations.	Thank you.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.	That would be nice, too.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?	I expect to try.
Well?	I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.	No, he takes after his mother...
You don't know him very well, do you?	He's my father.
I know him well enough?	Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
You got salt last week.	Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.	Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Of course, I do.	Very well, then.
Goodbye, Charlotte.	Goodbye.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.	Apology accepted.
Thank you.	Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Very well, let us move on to...	Prisoner exchange.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.	If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.	Sir.
What news?	The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.	When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Father...	It's already over.
How old are you?	You know how old I am.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.	Go on.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?	Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.	Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?	Harry, Harry, Harry...
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.	When?
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.	So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.	You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.	How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Goodbye, Francis.	Goodbye, Harry.
How far away?	Four, five miles.
Reverend.	I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.	For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...	He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Seventeen.	But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Father?	Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Father, you can't let them take him...	Quiet.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?	Well...I guess not.
Honey, Church will be fine.	But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
No-I guess not.	Yayyy!
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.	To remember.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--	That's enough, Ellen.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.	Do you believe that?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.	You believe in it.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Was it Pascow?	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
The one that goes into the woods--sure.	That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?	Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
It's Church.	I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Bagged cat. What a mess.	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
No need to apologize.	Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
But--	Does she love the cat?
What do you mean?	The place we're going is on the other side of that.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!	No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
You want to rest a bit before you start?	No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Doesn't look like they last long.	Don't worry about that.
But--	No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.	What did we do, Jud?
You and this old Indian rag-man--	Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?	Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--	The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.	Come on--let's parole 'em.
Gage's gone!	Jesus, the road!
Thank you. Thank you so much.	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---	Did you see his shirt?
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I heard you tonight.	I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
I'm going to try to do better.	You're doing fine.
You better get going, hon.	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!	Aye, aye, sir!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.	Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.	Wait as long as you like.
I'll watch my back.	Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
No, I really think I do.	All right then.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.	I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.	By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'	Very well.
You have a name, missy?	Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?	Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --	Will -- you can't trust him.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.	Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Man overboard!	Boy overboard!
You're speaking up for him again?	He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.	I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Actually, I find it all fascinating.	And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?	Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.	Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Why would my father send this to me?	To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
It doesn't!	-- but that was not a proper kiss.
You are despicable.	I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?	The trees are taller.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!	Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.	Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--	Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.	Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Dead serious.	You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.	As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
This dock is off-limits to civilians.	Sorry, I didn't know.
What's your name?	Smith.
Move!	No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Where does it make berth?	Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?	Why ask me?
Why are brothering with that?	My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!	Aye!  Avast!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.	I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.	You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--	Barbossa.
What's that?	Depends.
Jack!	-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.	The Black Pearl is a real ship.
He may be.	If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.	Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?	No.  She hasn't.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?	You got it, Dr. Argon.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.	Have you found Dr. Bright?
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.	You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.	The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.	It's ready now, I know it is.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!	Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.	In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?	Nebbleman.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?	Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?	Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.	Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.	Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?	I want Trix!  Mommy!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.	Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.	What did he want?
Of course, sir.	Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
I don't believe this is happening...	Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Is that what Argon told you?	No!  Well, not those exact words.
Susan!	Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Really?  What have you been doing?	You know, this and that.
Somebody has to.	Same old Daniel.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.	Yes.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.	Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.	The waste.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?	That's right.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?	No, why?
Is something wrong?	No, no, I just feel wired!
You have no one to blame but yourself.	Blame the victim.
Do you have something to bring me down?	No problem.
I could go with you.	I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
No cheese.	I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
That's pretty good.	Getting used to it.
That's going to fit me?	Like a glove.
You made this out of my hair?	Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Argon's private lab.	Let's go.
You saved my life.	Did you think I could just leave you...?
We've got to get the nanobot.	It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Things do change.	I guess they do.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!	Oh yes you are!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.	And you have him?
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --	Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.	Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.	Don't worry, four eyes.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.	'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?	Yes, he might be.
Exactly.	Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.	Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.	Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
I suppose you're going to print them?	No - give you another guess.
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.	Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Your place?	Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?	Of course I am Stewart.
Do you like them?	Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
You wear them of course, silly.	Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!	Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?	Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
No? What do you look upon her as?	Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.	I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?	Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
I'm not going!	What are you talking about?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.	Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?	Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?	But I don't want to meet your gang.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?	Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?	Your house?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.	You can't walk out of here like this.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.	Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Ah-ah-ah!	Mother!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]	Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Fine. Have a seat.	Thanks, I will.
Yale '21, I believe.	Huh?
Yeah!	But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Impossible. Put it on again.	Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?	Oh boy, I'd love it.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.	Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Yeah, little Gloria.	The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.	Well - it's only April.
Come on, get going, get going!	Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
What play?	My play.
You're my what?	Your valet, sir.
What are you doing fooling around in here?	Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
That's a canary, sir.	That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.	Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!	I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
Thanks, thanks.	I hope you'll be very happy.
My error.	Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.	Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.	Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.	No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.	Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...	And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?	Very good.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.	Sorry, boss—
Thanks. May I sit down?	Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.	She did—?
Some bicarbonate - quick!	Double strength!
Heavens! The man's insane!	Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Shhh! Do you hear something?	Yes, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?	I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?	Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Yes sir.	Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.	Thanks.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?	Yeah ...  That--and ...
You sure you want to know this?	Yes.
Yes ...  It's just that ...	What?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.	It can't be possible.
Does it look okay?	Looks just like it did.
Oh, hello Betty.	Hello Bill.
Having kind of a tough time.	I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?	Bud brought it to me.
What?	She's crying.
No she's not.	Yes she is.
It's alright. Let me see.	No ...
Like a drum.	Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.	Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.	Oh, gosh no.
... Why?	I think ... I might be ill ...
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.	It is?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...	Yeah ... How'd you know?
Want some bridge mix?	Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...	I'm fine--but thank you.
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.	One of those ... big beds?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.	Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
What happened?	Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.	Still doesn't make it right.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.	Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
I think I've got something to say.	Very well ...
What do you mean!?	Well, I never had to do it before.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.	Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Hear your Dad got a new car.	Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
No, not that hedge. The other one.	The other one?
God, David. Just give it to me!	Get lost!
Noooooo!	You--you gotta get us out of here.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!	We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.	What were you doing in a library?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...	Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
They're happy like this.	David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.	They don't have that kind of potential.
Are you sure?	I told you. I'm like positive.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.	No. You baked them for Whitey.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.	Oh ... Right.
Mmmmgh.	Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.	You don't know?
How?	Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.	Yeah.
What do we do?	We'll just put up the top.
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?	It was a prop for the school play ...
You're gonna forget about me.	No I won't. I swear.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?	Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?	Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?	Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Yeah ...	What department store did they go to?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."	That's right.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...	What the hell's going on!
Why would I do that?	Because we don't belong!
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.	No you're not.
EXCUSE ME?	I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...	They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.	I'm so glad you're here.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...	Listen to me!
Bud ...	Yeah ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...	Oh--what's the point, Bud?
TV repair.	TV repair?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.	What's the rush?
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.	What happened?
Dream come true, hunh?	This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Oh GOD ...	You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Well, I can't talk though --	You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Yes, I'll be there.	Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.	Ok. Thank you.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.	There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I know.	I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --	-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --	Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?	I don't know.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?	I'm gonna call you back.
You're so scared.	Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Tell me why.	There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Yes.	This is Georgia.
No.	I'm just laying on my bed.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?	Are you watching a porno movie?
No.	You have a girlfriend?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?	...yeah.....
I'm fine. Who is this?	Georgia.
I'm going to work.	Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Me?	Yeah.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.	Really? Please?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?	See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
Do you know them.	Not very well.
Hi.	Hi.
What do you do with all this pudding?	That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Oh My God.	It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.	Really?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --	-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.	-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
This is funny.	Yeah.
Who is it?	It's Barry.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....	Yeah?
Are you learning how to play it?	Yes? I'm trying.
That was good.	Yeah.
Have a good trip.	Thank you.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?	Yes.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?	I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Where do you have to go?	For what?
For work.....	I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yeah.	It's ok to ask that.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...	If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
If you wanted to call me back I could...	I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok.	Ok, bye, bye.
Why?	Just have you for one second, please.
I don't know.	You're hand is bleeding.
I didn't do that.	Why? ...what?
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.	Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.	Sorry.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?	...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?	No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?	What?
Can we agree that that is that?	That's that.
What's up?	Well I'm sorry. Before...
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --	I'm sorry.
Why you wearin' a suit?	Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.	WHICH?
What's up?	I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...	Where you goin?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.	Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.	What do you have in the house?
Yes.	Is this where you live?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...	This is a bunch of bullshit.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.	What time are you gonna be there?
Ok.	You can't be late though.
I'll see you there.	Don't puss out.
That's it.	Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Hello?	Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
What did you say?	Nothing.
I'll go pay for my car.	Are you sure?
Yeah.	He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?	Ok.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."	"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
In part, yes.	He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.	Why not?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --	You'll hate me now, won't you?
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --	Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I must grant him his last rites.	I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?	I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.	But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?	More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --	Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --	Valcour. His chair.
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.	Your wig. Remove your wig.
It's no secret that you loved her.	Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Don't confuse one organ with another --	I know, because I felt it myself --
Go to hell!	Why was it you never took her by force?
NEVER!	Then it must've been love --
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --	We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?	It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.	A few indiscretions in his youth.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.	Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.	Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
You're a sentimental man.	A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
And --?	He's sworn to obedience.
I have.	-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --	That's not our intent --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.	What could cause a tincture like this?
As for the author... shoot him.	A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?	I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Here it is; the last chapter.	Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"	I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."	Yes?
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?	It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.	Don't start --
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.	There's something else I want from you.
It's a long story, this one.	The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.	I pray you: be succinct.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.	Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...	I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?	It's tainted money, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.	And I in yours.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?	Of course.
This is neither the time nor the place --	If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.	It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
How was I to know, my darling?	How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --	He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
So you ever gonna do a picture?	Not you too
That poor woman.	She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!	Houdini mice.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.	Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--	I can't
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.	And he did.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?	One . . . buys things.
Then you explain it to me?!	There's nothing to explain
I just want to understand--	No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--	"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "	"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?	Huh?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?	We're using-
We find the man and then we dissect him-	Like a bug.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?	Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.	No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?	The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Oh Christ...	Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.	We're doing Hearst.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--	Don't do this
He'll destroy us.	Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
What?	Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?	K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '	Uh huh.
I want you back	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that	"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.	Christ.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.	Yeah, you're probably right.
Very generous	And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
You're going to destroy it	No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--	CITIZEN KANE
Pardon?	CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--	Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.	Please don't ask me to do this.
I think you better sit down	I don't want to sit
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.	It was fun, wasn't it?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--	Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Oh, no--	Yes!
You want to do the life of Jesus?	Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?	Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.	Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
What's up, Colonel?	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?	What?
J.R., glad you could make it.	You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
You know?	Yeah. Do me a favor.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.	Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Yeah --	Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
Go 'head.	You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.	What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.	Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.	You wasn't with her, were you?
You want us to wait for you?	No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Say what you're gonna say.	You want the title shot or not?
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.	This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Whatcha doin'?	I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.	What do you mean?
See? That's all there was to it.	What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Except fall down like a normal person.	Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.	What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
How's that?	I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.	Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?	No, I just told you what happened.
What?	You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...	So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Did you ever fuck my wife?	Whatsa matter with you?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.	Does that mean...
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.	Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.	You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
I can't find my ball.	Can you see it?
Can you see it?	No.
Are you sure we should be doing this?	Come over here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...	Come here.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?	I'm not interested in him.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?	Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.	All I did...
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?	Yeah --
I dunno.	Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.	Are you drunk?
Can't you get the money from your friends?	What friends?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?	Never felt better.
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.	Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!	All right, I'll try. See you later.
No, you're his wife.	I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
And you're drinking with them right now.	And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
This is Doyle's house.	This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.	Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.	Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.	But his leg!
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.	Namely?
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.	When the lock is broken -- yes.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?	Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.	I'll bet it's been done.
His wife took a trip.	She -- was -- an -- invalid!
By the way  what happened to your leg?	I was jaywalking.
-- until yesterday morning.	What time?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.	Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.	Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?	Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.	By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?	Mrs. Thorwald.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.	You think he's getting out of here?
Jewelry?	He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?	You figured that out, huh?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.	That depends on who "they" were.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!	You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?	Where'd they take Lisa?
For what?	For getting rid of that cast.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.	I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.	Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.	Why should I?
I predicted it.	How?
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.	It crashed, didn't it?
I knew it!	Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
That's normal.	I don't want to.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.	She's all right.
Her father loading up the shotgun?	Stella!
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.	I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.	How did you know!
What'll you do if one of them catches you?	Depends one which one.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.	Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
He and his wife splitting up?	It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.	It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.	You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
No.	There's probably one in the basement.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.	There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
What do you need money for?	To bail Lisa out of jail.
Yes.	Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Goodnight, you idiot.	Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
How's your leg?	Mmmm -- hurts a little.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.	We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Yes.	For what?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.	No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?	Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!	Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?	Right now, it doesn't seem so.
Don't you ever have any problems?	I have one now.
So do I.	Tell me about it.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.	You'd better before you catch the disease!
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.	Someone not his wife?
I wonder where he's going now?	I don't know.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.	Thinking about Thorwald?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.	I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?	You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.	Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.	How?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.	Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.	Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Shut up. I'm all right.	Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Feel okay?	Give me some dirt.
Machismo?	Somebody find him a knife.
Just him.	Stay there.
Buzz Gundersen.	Hi.
Sure.  It's fine.	Okay.
I like you, you know?	Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
You see any cops?	No--
What time is it?	Hang loose.  We got all night.
Tell him why we moved here.	Hold it, Jim.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.	Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
What can you do when you have to be a man?	Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?	You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Except yourself!	Will you wait a minute?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--	Sorry.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.	Have some cigars.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.	A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--	Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Frank!	Stay here.  That was my son!
John Crawford?	Yes, sir.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.	What's the charge?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?	My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Hi.	Hi there.
No.  It's perpetual motion.	Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
How'd you get here?	I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.	My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
It's me!	How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Come out come out wherever you are!	Shut up.  Are you nuts?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?	Wow!  Well now-there-then!
I came here before.	When was that?
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?	Plato!
Plato?	I'm here.
That's swell.  How are you?	I'm fine.
Why?	I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?	We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
You promised to give it back.	Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.	Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Plato!	Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
What?	Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.	Grandma?
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?	No.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?	Leave me alone.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?	Mess that kid up?
If he could--	"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.	Chicken?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.	Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
You don't have to be unfriendly.	Now that's true!
See?	"Life is crushing in on me."
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.	Where what was.
See, I'm new.	Won't mother be proud.
Yeah--why--	Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?	University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.	A what?
They'll be looking for you.	They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?	No.
Where you going?	I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Ever been in a place like this before?	Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?	I don't know.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--	You don't need to do that.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.	Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Is he your friend?	Yes.  My best friend.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?	Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Plato, where's your father now?	He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Judy--we're ready for you now.	He hates me.
What?	He hates me.
That one?	Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?	I'll never get close to anybody.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.	My mother?
How did you know that?	We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!	We were romantic then too--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.	With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Good evening.	Hi.
Didn't you forget something?	What?
A man of some travels.	GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?	Please, Gabriel, don't...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...	To all those cons...
Saw me --	Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.	I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.	Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.	We could live it up and --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!	Nick, I love you --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.	He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Your pen palls dead, lady.	If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--	Jack. Jack Bangs.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --	But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...	So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...	We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
We get to the bridge, we're all right!	Nick, the ice is --
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.	You saved me.
I love you, Nick...	Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
They'll have guns.	What?
He wants to see your map.	I'm almost done.
No.	We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.	We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!	Yeah. That's love.
You... you... YOU --	We still gonna spend Christmas together?
I saved your life.	You shouldn't have.
What?	Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.	I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
Who are you now.	You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Put him in the truck.	I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.	I never worked at no casino.
I had better sex in prison.	Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?	J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
You do.	At least gimme video poker.
Do I get a country-western name?	You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?	Don't tip.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?	Nothing... I promise-nothing...
Can't be attracting attention, right?	What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?	Leave the tree.
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.	I don't know... what you're...
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!	What... Powwow...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!	GO!!!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?	We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
The Powwow Safe?	His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...	Hi, Nick.
What the hell was that about --	He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --	I promise you, I didn't know!
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!	Fuckin, Zookerman --
Why you gotta say a thing like that.	I'm just saying.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.	Thought you hate your old man.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.	What, working security?
Just a roach, Zook.	Good for you. Protein.
Rudy, don't move --	Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Don't move, Rudy!	Standing right here, man!
GUARD! GUARD!	Alamo...
Do what?	Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --	Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
POP! That was My card!	But... I had a five...
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -	Thanks, don't mind if I do.
How ya doin', Toothpick?	Fine, now.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.	You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.	Who?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.	Was he all pissed off?
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.	It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
The motherfucker killed Vic.	How do you know all this?
Daddy, did ya see that?	What?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.	Really? Who's your P.O.?
I don't know, but somebody did.	Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.	Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.	I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.	What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.	Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?	This better not be some Freddy joke.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...	...What bar?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.	You ever seen this motherfucker before?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.	How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.	Did the two of you talk?
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?	Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What's this?	It's a scene. Memorize it.
What?	A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
What?	Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.	What for?
Mr. Brown?	Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
I'm sorry.	What? Snap out of it!
Who's your parole officer?	A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.	What do you care?
What's she doin' now?	She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Your name's Freddy something.	Freddy Newendyke.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?	Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?	What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Why?	It's a surprise.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?	You didn't ask.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.	You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.	I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.	Lie back down, and try to -
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.	Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What's wrong with it?	The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
No real people?	Uh-uh, just cops.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.	That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?	You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.	That was the plan, we meet here.
No shit?	Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.	That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?	Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.	You gotta idea, spit it out.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.	Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...	Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.	Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
You don't know how good it is to see you.	Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Yes, ma'am.	As far as -- Sonora?
So am I.	It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
But you eat, don't you?	Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Where do you keep the can opener?	In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.	And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.	Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?	I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.	The who?
But the rest is right.	Will she be dark or fair?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.	Maybe it's better that way.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.	If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
All my clothes --	That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.	There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?	Why?
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.	Which ranch?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.	Like what?
What was he in jail for?	You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.	That's right, Steve.
Can I have my gun back?	Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.	I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.	You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.	You better start.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.	I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
What did you come back for?	Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.	So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
Yeah, how did you know?	The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
I can't take her with me.	Nobody asked you to.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.	I don't care.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?	He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
But I want to stay.	Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Stop it -- stop it.	Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
That sure smells good.	I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.	Then why stay in the hills.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.	Well, say it.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?	Depends on how good you drive.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.	They shouldn't have done that.
Goodbye and thanks.	I don't like to see you go.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?	Maybe in Sonora.
Maybe I could start you out.	That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Gee, I can't.	Why not? You went farther than that last time.
What comes after Z?	That's the end of the line.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!	There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
What do they look like?	Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
How about California?	Would they be good to eat?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.	Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.	Steve --
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.	I think he wants me.
That's it.	Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.	Okay... maybe that would be best.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.	Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Ouch!!	Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hello Brenda.	Hello Ray.
Where's Shorty?	I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Hey, you left your book back there.	Thanks. I'm Cindy.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.	Yeah.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.	Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...	Alright!
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?	Hugh Kane.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?	Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...	It's okay.
Oh, right.	Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?	This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...	Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.	Thanks. I made them by hand.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?	I don't need your help.
Yes, we made it!	We? What do you mean... we?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....	My child you are the only survivor.
I'm sorry.	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
That was a great idea, Shorty.	I told you it would taste just like chicken.
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.	And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?	In about fifteen minutes.
Would you please focus?	Fine.  What's all this stuff?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?	That one.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.	Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?	Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.	That's right.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?	Oh, I couldn't do that.
She's right. We should stick together.	Alright. Come on, you guys.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?	Yours, or the turkeys?
You never could feel your legs.	What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
You're not wearing a belt.	Alright, go to the belt store...
Uh... I'm Father McFeely	Father, come in, please.
Father, I think you should rest.	No, I'm fine.
This part removes the sense of humor.	I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.	Get out?! What does it say?
Oh, boy! 	Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
0h, shit!	You don't think...
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....	MURDERED?!!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.	Always the dentist.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"	I certainly did not.
Chip, honey?	Thanks, Mom.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!	Looks good, Mom!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.	I'm so happy I could shit.
In here, Mom...	But, Chip...
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?	That's right.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!	Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
He goes to college with me!	Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.	Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Beverly! Not the Sterners!	It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?	Oh, honey!
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?	Yes, I did.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?	Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Hello.	Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!	Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...	It's not fair!!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!	But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?	Yes, I was.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!	Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Beverly, are you alright?	Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.	Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?	...Browsing.
Mrs... Sutphin?	Right here!
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.	He's a good boy.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...	That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.	Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!	Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
Man, that one made me puke!	You forgot something...
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee	I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?	Yes. She bought my sister's business.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.	You think my sister is there?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.	If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I don't like this.	Which room is it?
It's only a little way, Mr. August.	I'd like to get out of here.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?	Yes, I understand.
Then, you also understand that you must die.	No.
When I wanted to.	It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.	You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I'll give you a check.	She can only use cash.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?	Oh, as beautiful as ever.
But tell me --	She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
How's Miss Jacqueline?	I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.	But I like teaching school.
Redi's all right.	She seems rather an odd woman to me.
And that was all?	No. She asked about the trademark.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.	Thank you.. .goodnight.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.	But you have treated me that way.
The people at the restaurant?	Yes.
 What have you done about Irving August?	Oh, I'm making investigations.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.	Good night.
I'm going to find your sister.	I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?	I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.	We could tell him.
She'll have to know some time.	Not from me.
Who are you?	I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.	I'm afraid.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.	Why wait?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.	I won't get lonely.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."	You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...	I can imagine.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --	Don't make me tell you, Jason.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?	Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,	I understand.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?	I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?	What a peculiar question.
What was she to you?	I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.	You don't expect me to do that do you?
Yes. When I tell you.	Tell me what?
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?	I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
What?	They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.	You know where she is?
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.	It seems right to us.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.	Thank you, my dear.
I'll be out in a minute.	That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
That makes it all the more difficult ——	Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.	Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.	Of course.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.	I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.	What did he say?
Is it fifteen minutes yet?	No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.	When?
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --	I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.	What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.	Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Oh, uh-huh.	Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
No, I think you look... fine.	Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.	What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.	Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Why? Didn't you know him well?	I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.	What's the first?
Why is that?	I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.	Agreed.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?	Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Aren't you?	Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Hi!	Ann. Hello.
It's a personal project I'm working on.	What kind of personal project?
And they just answer them?	Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I don't... why... why do you do this?	I'm sorry this came up.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.	Why not?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.	What difference does it make why I do it?
Is he going to see this?	Absolutely not.
No.	Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
About me?	Yes.
Why not?	If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
That's correct.	So you have had sex.
Yes.	Who was the last person you had sex with?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".	So you lied to her?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --	But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
You mean you're still in contact with her?	No.
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.	As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Don't do that.	Why not?
Because.	"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Why are you ashamed?	Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?	No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.	You did that?
Something wrong?	Are you having an affair?
There's nothing to know, Ann.	I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.	Is that supposed to comfort me?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.	Always the lawyer.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."	You've made your point.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.	Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?	I want out of this marriage.
Bastard...	He does.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.	Yeah, I know.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?	Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?	Is he still at your house?
No, he left last week.	Did you find him attractive?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.	But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
What are you talking about?	He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
I just thought it might --	Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.	What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.	Well, what, then?
He just asked me questions.	What kinds of questions?
I wanted him to see me.	Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You couldn't do it, period.	You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
I feel like I do.	That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.	There's a phone here.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?	Why don't you let me tape you?
And you ask questions, right?	Yes.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?	It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
What did he say?	He said that my hand felt good.
Would you like me to take my pants off?	If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you think I'm pretty?	Yes.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.	Is that what he tells you?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?	Okay.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.	So make an exception.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.	Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.	Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.	Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
John?	In here!!
Not today. I've got other plans.	Oh.  Well, when, then?
John Millaney.	I want to see you.
Hello.	Cynthia. John.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.	You told Ann about this?
It won't. I trust him.	You trust him.
John, we have nothing to talk about.	I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Plus first and last month deposit.	Will you lease month-to-month?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?	You were prying before?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.	Or go someplace in a hurry.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.	No.
Answer him, goddammit!!	You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
May I ask who's calling?	John Millaney.
Mr. Millaney?	Yes?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?	He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.	Was he nice to you?
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.	I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?	Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Well? Supper at my place?	OK. But late.
You say something?	Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...	I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Want me to breathe deeply?	Just breathe normally.
Good shape for an old man, eh?	Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.	You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?	It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.	I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?	Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT	BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?	Of course.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?	On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
How did you come by this scenario?	I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
In a way...	I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
McKinley?...McKinley?	Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT	SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.	Shove it, Ralph!
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?	No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART	YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.	He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Vance!  Vance Parker.	Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD
Brad!	I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
BRAD!	Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...	Farley!
F for...	Flavors!
Our speciality.	I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
That's an extremely negative response.	Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE	LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And none of them worked?	No.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.	We're not confused.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.	It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?	I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
The fuck was that?	The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --	Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Are you there? Miles?	Yeah, I'm here.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.	So I guess that's it.
My condolences.	What are you pouring tonight?
What do you think?	Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?	Highliner.
They're from both of us.	A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?	Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.	Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?	Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?	Stephanie.
Hi.	Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
I can explain.	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Highliner, please.	That's on us.
Are you a writer too?	No, I'm an actor.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.	Well, in that case...
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...	Yeah, Conundrum.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.	Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
And?	I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?	Oh yeah. Much better.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.	Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Whoa, why are we getting off?	I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.	It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --	Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.	It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.	I'd rather have a knife.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.	Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.	Let me call Christine.
This is rose, right?	Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What do you smell?	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.	It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.	Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.	If that's what feels right.
Here's to my last week of freedom.	It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.	You know her?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.	Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.	Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Have you no shame?	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.	Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.	Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!	I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.	You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.	I'm a quick learner.
We're on.	What?
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.	Well, she is cute.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.	Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.	Aye-aye, captain.
Pull yourself together, man.	I'm fine!
Where were you?	Bathroom.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.	Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Oh, boy.	She's been leaving messages here too.
What the fuck are you doing?	What?
Does she know about Saturday?	Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.	Understanding of what?
Like I might be in love with another woman.	In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.	You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Call me on my cell if you go out.	Yeah.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?	Nope.
Huh.	They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?	What exactly are we going to do?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?	He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
What?	It's private.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?	Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.	Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
She tell you she was married?	Yeah.
So what's the plan?	The plan is... you go.
Come on, let me drive.	I'm fine. You rest.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.	You need a new car anyway.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?	You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?	The Windmill.
Oh yeah? How is it?	Try it.
I'm having the salmon.	That's what I'm having.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?	I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.	What was the bottle that did it?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?	I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
So what's your novel about?	Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?	"The Day After Yesterday."
Yeah? Like what?	Like what a fraud he was.
Bathroom over there?	Yeah.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.	Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.	What rehearsal dinner?
Were you ever going to say anything?	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.	Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.	Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.	Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?	Ken.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
That's great.	So how're you doing?
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.	I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.	See you over there, Miles.
How much skin and stem contact?	About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?	About a year.
So what do you think?	Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Huh.	Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.	You golf?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.	Where?
See you, Miles. You take care.	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?	It tastes old.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?	I heard them Morgan.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.	My ballet recital.
I'm scared.	Me too.
And tell Merrill to swing away.	What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!	This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
It's noise.	It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
How can you say that?	That wasn't the answer you wanted?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?	What's furry, furry rabbit?
Chicken Teriyaki.	Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Should we turn off the lights?	They already know we're here.
They're distracting us?	From what?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.	Have they said anything about our area?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.	I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Don't touch him.	Graham.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?	Yes.
These are D's; I need double A's.	I have some upstairs.
I can't even imagine.	I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
It's the strangest thing Father.	Don't call me Father.
You said something was strange. What's strange?	The footprints.
What about them?	There are none.
Okay.  So he was tall?	I would say so.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.	Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
I don't think so.	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Is he okay?	Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
She's not in an ambulance Father.	Why not?
Don't do it!	You'll lose the signal!
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.	What book!
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.	Your next water ain't for three days.
Emmett.	McKendrick.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.	I'm sorry.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.	I just came out to say goodbye.
Goodbye?	Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.	Didn't Paden tell you that?
Are you all right?	This is a brutal land.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.	How's Mr. Parker doing?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.	That I do.
Jefferson City?	No, Leavenworth.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?	I had to get up anyway.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?	Where's the pinto going?
Doesn't look quite fair.	Which way do you mean?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.	I understand.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.	No hard feelings.
You might make a farmer yet.	I've got a job.
Where is Rae?	She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Who?	The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
What about the law?	Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.	I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Never will again.	We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.	His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?	We didn't get that far.
You can't do this.	Really?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?	I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Hello, Rae.	What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.	Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.	It's none of your business.
Why come to me?	Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
What's stopping you?	They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Yeah, it's working out real good.	Where's Emmett now?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.	I heard that too.
I've given that up.	So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.	Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
What is it you want from me?	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.	So we understand each other?
I'm going to have to look into this.	Yeah, maybe I will too.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.	I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.	Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?	I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
It's the only place I'm happy.	Me too. What's wrong with us?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.	So-called?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.	Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.	Who's the owner?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.	Who?
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.	No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.	No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.	It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.	We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?	You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.	I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
I can't wait to meet her.	I don't know if that's going to happen.
Viktor, it's my studio.	She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."	"Forever".
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.	There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Hair and make-up?	She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?	I'll send you her resume.
There isn't one.	No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.	Simone does not control my destiny.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.	That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.	Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.	Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?	She said you were very beautiful.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.	I do?
My two favorite girls.	Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
... Simone.	She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
As a matter-of-fact I am.	When is she coming over?
I just read somewhere --	I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?	I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.	Not if I don't let her.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.	Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?	How can you bring that up at a time like this?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?	That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.	No... it's life.
Where are you?	Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Mom, do you miss Dad?	Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.	Just a minute.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.	He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
You're with me to be close to her?	Is that a problem?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?	I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.	Clyde.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.	It was more in passing.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.	How did the wall get there?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.	I know what you mean.
-- We call them "vactors".	I need flesh and --
Not quite how I imagined it --	-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?	I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Okay, Dad.	If anyone asks about Simone --
Good-night, Daddy.	Night, Lainey.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?	I do okay.  How about you?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.	I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.	I could get the death penalty.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.	I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I know what you're up to.	I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.	-- I bet you have.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.	Abduction?
You love her, don't you, Max?	Don't you?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.	Why?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.	Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Mr. Sayer...	What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?	-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.	Is that why she left you?
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.	Yes.
Good morning, Simone.	Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Maybe he can.	Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
The only real truth is in the work.	You know what I'm talking about.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.	Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.	Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Are you calling me?	What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Why, Malcolm?	What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
All your soldiers speak Latin?	No, just one.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.	Congratulations.
Know what?	That I'm a freak.
What kind of words?	Upset words.
I didn't know you were funny.	I forgot myself.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--	Dr. Crowe.
Yes.	You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.	You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?	No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
How often do you see them?	All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
...No.	Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Yes?	And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Can I ask you then?	Yes.
What do you want more than anything?	I don't know.
I told you what I want.	I don't know, Cole.
--What?	Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Don't cry.	It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Dr. Crowe?	Yes.
Are you wigging out?	Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?	No, we're not.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.	You do?
You know that accident up there?	Yeah.
Dead people?	Ghosts.
You see ghosts, Cole?	They want me to do things for them.
What are you thinking, Momma?	...I don't know.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.	They were the ones who hanged everybody.
Excuse me?	You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!	Who!
Stuttering Stanley!	S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!	S-ssssstop it!
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.	Meaning?
'Course, it's none of my business.	Let's say today, we make it your business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?	Superstition.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.	Oh yeah? Why's that?
See?	You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck you.	Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Bitch.	Slut.
Come on --	Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Sounds familiar.	Book of Jeremiah.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"	Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
You're out of your mind, man.	I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.	Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
So... what does it do?	It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Should we be doing this, dude?	Metaphysical question, man.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?	Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.	Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
I came back for the funeral. That's all.	Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.	This is his room... isn't it?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.	"Blood?"
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.	Who? Us?!
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.	You got something against farm people, Keith?
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.	What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
You never told us you grew up on a farm.	Nothing to tell.
Suzie --	Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
You're... limping.	I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
Suzie... No.	It's you. You and your father.
No Mac, please... I --	Don't look.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...	You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
...no... Mac... p-please...	Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.	What'll we do?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.	I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.	Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!	Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
What are you doing?!	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --	You took Bill.
What?	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Rorschach.	What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog	Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
It's just a work thing.	Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --	I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!	Grant, no!
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.	Through a wound on his stomach?
When one sees you they all see you.	An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.	Margaret.
You.	Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Get your hands off my daughter!	Your what?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.	What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?	For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Well?...	Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Driving, talking to me...	They're both a challenge.
Seriously?!?	Would I lie to you?
Anything?	We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know, you're not a bad driver.	You know, you're not a bad passenger.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.	I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
What the hell are you doing?!?	He's after us again!
Yeah.	Yeah.
Mississippi's the other way!	You want to lose this putz or not?!?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?	Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.	Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
An unmarked police car.	How do you know?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.	You take the front, I'll take the back.
I'm proud of you.	Yeah?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.	Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Why are you stopping?	Weight Station.
See ya, Bandit.	See ya, Kate.
Why should I?	Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
But you'll do it?	I'll do it.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.	Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.	No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.	Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
What are you doin' now?	Running blocker.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.	I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Loud and clear.	Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Let's get the hell outta here.	Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
You can't swear on these.	What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?	If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Just fine. What's the weather like?	God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You're coming up to the scale house.	I'm cucumber cool.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.	What's that, pardner?
How's the clock, Bandit II.	Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.	Go head on, breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?	Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?	Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Five thou.	Chickenshit money.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?	-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?	-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?	Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Is your security team armed?	Of course. Yes.
Anything on the Swede?	Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.	Maybe.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?	Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?	That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
What about the sheriff's task force?	Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Did he give you his name?	Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --	-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Who?	The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
I did. We -- yeah, I know.	And threw us into the lake.
Are you on a land line?	Yeah, why.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.	Then what --
D'you talk to'm?	I got his machine.
What'd you say?	I said I got his machine.
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.	Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
FUCK YOU!	GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --	I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.	I thought Heller was a double op?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.	You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
My debrief --	-- will be handled back in --
You're finished.	And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.	So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...When did you know all this?	Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
You got clicks, anything?	Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --	-- okay, g'head --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.	Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Wow.	Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Shoot.	A million flat.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --	Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
That takes some of the sting out.	I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.	I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.	I can trust Rheya.
You'll end up like me.	You're not Gibarian...
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.	All right.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?	The same thing that could happen to any of us.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?	What?
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.	What was it?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.	I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.	Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.	But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?	Yes.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...	Her oxygen would have run out.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.	I won't be making the trip.
Don't.	Why?
We're taking a flight?	Yes.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".	Book?
He has a point.	He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?	It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.	For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.	Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
What do I have to do to stop it?	I want you here.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?	Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Is that really what you want?	I want to stop taking those pills.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.	You must have been dreaming.
Hi.	I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...	Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
What did he say?	He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Would you pick one out, please?	Beg pardon?
Put it on my account, please.	I got money.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.	If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?	Urdu and Hindi.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?	They're kind of fuzzy.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.	No kidding.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!	No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!	Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
What about Neil?	You don't like him, do you?
You asked.	He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
You put me life in danger.	No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.	Claire...!
Stop, will you?!	Let go!
I do care about you!	More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Yeah.	They called here after you left...
Where?	Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.	Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
What a memory.	Do you dance?
Do you?	Pretty bad.
They guys treatin' you all right?	Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.	I know.
You still going away?	I don't know...
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.	It was something my father always liked me to do.
Keep what handy?	Nothing.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?	Sure we are, let's go!
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?	Too kinky.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.	Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
For how long?	'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.	I can still use a gun.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?	I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey.  The neighbors.	Let 'em eat their hearts out.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?	Oh, some shit.
Honey.  You got him.	I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She's got to identify him.	Why?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?	No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
What did she say the down payment was?	She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?	Ellie, it was a formal party...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?	She bought it.
Mike, take it easy...	Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What did you watch?	I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...	Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...	You talked to his wife?
Ellie...	I'm all right.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.	Me neither.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!	You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
What about when she identifies him?!	If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!	Koontz!  I need you guys!
Who's Joey Venza?	Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
No, I will not step outside.	Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.	That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.	I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Sexual tension...	Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.	You stop him?
Cause if you get in a bind--	No, no.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--	Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Lizzy!	I was sort of hoping to get out of--
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.	They'll never take me alive.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.	Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
How are you doing, kid?	Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.	Right.
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--	I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?	Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--	Just call me Spidey.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?	Well...
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.	When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I hate--	I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.	Thank God.
Well, no.	So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
You'd feel what?	Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Hello, Liz.	Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.	But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Aunt May, you're trespassing.	Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
It's Friday night...	Yes.  Do you have a date?
The record--	It'll shut itself off.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.	How is he?
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--	Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--	Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Your dog ate it.	Actually, I got this spider bite…
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -	Luck.  The right place at the right time.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.	Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?	Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.	Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
You're sure you're all right.	Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--	Imagine how I feel.
Loonytunes.  And yet...	Just drop me off here.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?	Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Jawohl.	Is you all little Adolfs?
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.	I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?	That'll do.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?	In this barracks?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?	Anybody here wanna double their bet?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.	You stink, Sefton!
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!	Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?	That's right.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.	Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Put me down for ten, you louse.	I'll call the whole pot.
How did he get over there?	Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.	Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?	Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.	Twenty-five.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.	What is your number?
105-353.	That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?	Abfuehren!
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.	I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.	They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.	All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Jawohl!	Some are not bad at all.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!	Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.	What's the award?
Harry -- I'm blind!	Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do those broads say?	What do they always say?
Let me do it, Hoffy.	You want to go?
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?	Yes, sir.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --	Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.	Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?	Good.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.	You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Why the south latrine?	Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Los, los. Dummkopf!	Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.	One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Stay out of it, Sefton.	Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?	Are we boring you?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.	Says who?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?	That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
How do they know?	You told them, Hoffy.
You off your rocker?	Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?	Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.	Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
December seventh, forty-one.	What time?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.	Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?	Ich weiss alles.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?	Here. Take them.
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!	Talk what? I do not know anything!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?	Not particularly.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.	We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
So you're stuck with me, eh?	Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.	He is.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.	The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Data, are you all right?	No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.	Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?	I believe so.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?	I believe so.
I get it. I get it.	You get what?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.	The station complement was nineteen.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.	I hope so, sir.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.	All hands, brace for impact!
Where is he now?	Wherever he wanted to be.
Can I?	Yes, where would you go?
Beautiful day, isn't it?	Yes, yes, it is.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.	I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?	Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
No, no, it's not. It's better.	Better?
Yes.  Thank you.	Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.	What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.	And what would that be, sir?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?	No.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?	No, I didn't know that.
Is there a problem?	No, sir.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.	Understood. That will be all.
Report.	A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Captain, are you all right?	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.	What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.	Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.	Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.	Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Tractor beam, aye!	If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!	He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!	Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Will we get another ship?	I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.	Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.	Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Response?	Nothing. As before.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.	Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Could it be Spock's?	It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!	Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...	A photon tube...!
Did your collaborator know?	My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...	... How long?
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.	I'll go...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...	Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.	I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.	Sir...?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.	Saavik... Is... David with you?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.	But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.	And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
The word, sir?	The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Count on our help, sir.	I'll need it, Sulu.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?	... A cloaking device?
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.	It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.	Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?	That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!	That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!	Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.	Any time.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!	All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...	You should take the Vulcan, too.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...	You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!	He would not have spoken of it openly.
Bones!...	One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!	Success, my lord.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.	Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --	They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
You're not going in there -- !	I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --	I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.	Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.	Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --	And who am I hiding from?
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.	I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
Shore leave, Admiral.	Ah.
It never rains but when it pours --	As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
They even killed the galley chief.	This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --	And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.	Why? Why didn't you tell me?
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.	And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
David --	Mother, go back!
Don't tell me you've got something.	We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I told you! I told you I saw a --	Ssssh!
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!	What's the matter -- ?
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?	Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.	Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.	I see. Helmsman?
I'm Admiral Kirk...	<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
Why didn't you tell me?	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --	<u>Full power damn you</u>!
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?	Aye, sir.
Mr. Scott on discrete.	Scotty, let's have it.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.	My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --	All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Yes, Spock.	Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?	Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?	Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.	Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.	Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...	You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?	I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
It literally is Genesis...	The power of creation --
What's she doing here?	Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?	It would explain a great many things --
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !	Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Not enough against their shields.	Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
The prefix code?	It's all we've got.
A distinct possibility.	Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
In my quarters, Uhura.	Yes, sir.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...	Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
I failed to resolve the situation.	There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?	You may ask, Lieutenant.
Indeterminate life signs.	Phasers on stun. Move out.
Admiral?	As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
How?	I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Hold your course. Look sharp...	At what.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!	Aye, sir.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...	Understood, sir.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...	Aye, sir --
I really must thank you.	I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...	Engage warp engines --
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.	Try again.
Admiral on the bridge --	Battle stations.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.	I'll try, Captain.
Fire all phasers...!	No power to the weapons system, sir.
He's not what I expected, Sir.	What did you expect, Lieutenant?
All moorings are clear, Captain.	Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --	Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Certainly...	By the book...
I do this because I was there,	Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I would accept that as an axiom.	Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.	Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?	I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..	Would you prefer to do nothing?
It doesn't look all that different.	Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
He's coming 'round, Jim...	Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?	It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?	Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.	I liked him better before he died.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.	That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.	... Best shot...?
... I don't think he understands...	No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
What the hell do you think you're doing?	Reading the patient's vital signs.
What's your degree in, dentistry?	How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination --	Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.	My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
What's causing that!?	Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
... It gives me a great sense of history.	It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
My name?	No, <u>my</u> name.
Status report, Admiral!	Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Attempting the hell to communicate.	Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?	You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
You mean man...	To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!	How soon?
We don't want to be any trouble.	You've already been that. C'mon.
Then --	In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Or believe, I'll bet.	Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?	Just lucky, I guess.
What's that?	What's what?
Wanna try it from the top?	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.	You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Here... In the park?	Right.
It's true... what you said...	Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Steady, now. We need your help.	Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.	What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Hey! -- Where you going?!	You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?	Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?	The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?	There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.	What are the variables...?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.	How do you know this...?
Come on, fellah -- speak up!	Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?	The hell I can't
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?	Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Can we make breakaway speed!?	Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Spock: Condition report!	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...	Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
10 seconds, sir!	Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
I have no control, sir!	Picture, Uhura!
What is it?	Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.	From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.	On screen.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?	Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Scotty, how long is this bay?	About 60 feet, Admiral.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?	I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.	Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
The whales...?!	No power to the bay doors.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?	Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.	Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.	Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --	Millions?
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.	... Yes?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  	Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.	Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.	We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.	But not you.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...	... an offlander?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.	I'll be here.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?	The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.	You're what?
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.	I understand.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.	Perhaps, that is true.
No... I want to stay with you...	It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.	The artificial lifeform was right?
Hello, Data...	Captain, Geordi...?
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.	What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?	I don't know.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...	I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.	He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.	Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...	That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.	This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.	Understood.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...	... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?	There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.	If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.	Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?	No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...	Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?	May I talk to you alone?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...	No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?	When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.	The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...	So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
Implants bothering you?	It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...	Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...	On screen.
What's inside that nebula cluster?	Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...	We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.	We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...	We're not going anywhere.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.	Aye, sir.
Would you like something to eat?	No, we're here to... rescue them.
Worf, you must hurry...	We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...	It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Come out, come out wherever you are...	Sir?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.	Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...	Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...	Why was Data assigned?
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...	What are they interested in...?
What you're doing to my neck...	Was I doing something to your neck?
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...	But it's comfortable.
Why don't you try sitting up?	Or you could try lying down.
... I'm not sleeping well...	... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?	They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?	Absolutely.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?	Yes...
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.	Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.	How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.	You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...	I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Is it Japanese?	Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
No. I will not betray my friends.	They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.	No... no, please... you cannot...
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.	What?
Who are you?	I am the Borg.
This must be it.	How serious is the damage?
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.	There should be some kind of manual release...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.	It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Ready to make a little history?	Always am.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.	<U>Engage.</U>
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?	We're crossing the threshold!
Where are you from most recently?	California. San Francisco.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?	I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
What do you want?	The invasion plans.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?	Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Did you need something?	Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --	'Fraid not.
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.	I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I'd say you already have.	Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
We?	Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Track their weapons fire.	Western hemisphere... North American continent...
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...	They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Report.	We're still in Earth orbit.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.	Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.	Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.	We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.	We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
What are they doing?	They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...	I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Someone...?	The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
I remember it made me sick.	What are you suggesting?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?	Commander... we have a problem.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.	At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Spock, that was actually funny.	We DO sleep lying down.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...	We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
Thanks...	What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!	Come on...
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.	And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
This is fun...	Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
Too bad we can't SMELL her.	In space, no one can hear you sweat.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.	They'll make it look like an accident...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?	I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
They'll respect him now...	That's a comfort...
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...	I beg your pardon?
He's a DOCTOR!	How can I trust --
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.	He just tried to save him!
What?	Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.	There... were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?	That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.	Those words WERE spoken by me.
Where is Mr. Sulu?	Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??	Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --	Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
From Starfleet?	Who else?
She's here - somewhere.	But if she's cloaked...
Shields. Battle stations.	Shields up. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.	Aye, sir; thrusters...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.	Now we go to Starfleet?
Aye, sir.	Mr. Valtane, any more data?
An INCIDENT?	Do we report this, sir?
Thank you, Captain.	Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.	We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...	Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.	Except us.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...	Energize...
As you were. Lieutenant...?	Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Aye, sir.	Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Captain, our shields -- !	Uhura, signal our surrender.
Who is "US?"	I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.	Sulu!
Where?	Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Captain...	He was just about to explain the whole damn -
The peace conference.	What peace conference?
Are you dining on worms?	You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
What's she waiting for?	Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Control tower, reading, Sir.	Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Channel open, Captain.	This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Gorkon's own man??	Who else?
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.	Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
You must have faith.	Faith...?
How did you - ?	In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Her own father...?	Such things have happened before, sir.
If you are logical.	I don't want to.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.	You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.	Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -	We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
And if they're still in place?	Then someone forged a data bank entry.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!	This one can.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.	Yes, sir.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...	He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?	I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?	No.
Why?	Because you are dangerous.
Why?	You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?	No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?	No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.	For how long?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.	Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.	Is he very much like you were?
A weapon.	It would appear so.
Yes, sir.	We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
What do you imagine this is?	Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.	It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Why am I looking at me?	You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.	Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.	An individual more like you, you mean.
Yes.	Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.	Emergency force fields are holding.
What is our approximate distance?	
It's you.	The resemblance is... striking.
No.	I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.	The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.	As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.	How could I not?
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.	Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?	Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.	When this is over, I owe you a drink.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.	What do we know about the planet?
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.	Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.	Aye, sir.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.	Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
	Just lucky, Admiral.
To find the head, sir?	If you don't mind.
What's this?	Your new chair, sir.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.	Still well on our side...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.	Thank you, sir...
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --	I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
It's working.	Counselor?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.	And the Romulans invade.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.	She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
Anything.	When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.	Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
You know I need to verify this.	I know.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.	You'll acquire a taste for it.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.	You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.	There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Were we always explorers?	No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?	I always hoped I would hit two meters.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...	You're not Reman.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.	We are.
Yes.	So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
That's your life... not mine.	Please.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.	It is... invigorating.
The bond is broken.	Find her again.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!	She is here.
How many Warbirds will you need?	None.
But surely...	I came this far alone ...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!	You don't have to understand.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?	Silence, Romulan!
Benny, God, take it easy...	I don't want to scare them away.
What can I do for you folks?	How much are your rooms?
Credit card.	I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...	It's still the full price.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?	We should have. Let me see.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.	I understand.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...	Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...	It's in a green Mustang?
I don't like it, George...	Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...	We don't know what else to do. We need results.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.	I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.	George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.	You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Hello George.	Shermin...
What's all this for?	We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
George... Do you hear me, George?	What?
I just retired.	Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?	Marc Shermin.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.	Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
What?	What.
Ah... no...	Ah no.
What?!	Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...	Good.
What?	Smile.
Go.	It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
What?	Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Are you from up there? Space?	Space?
Shit.	Shit?
I will see it next time.	You better.
When do you have to be here?	I do not understand.
Sun...	Yes.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?	No.
No... The closest...	Why?
What is hitchhike?	That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...	'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?	Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes.	I am your friend.
Nobody knows.	Why?
You can have one.	I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.	I can't stay on this planet.
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.	I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You are cold.	You're damn right I am.
What?	Nothing.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?	Do they talk?!
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.	I understand.
Oh, you're pretty...	I gave you a baby last night.
The cook again?	Yes.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.	Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
What will you say about us?	I will say that we can be friends.
How long will it take you to get home?	Many, many days and nights...
Where do you think you're going?	Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...	Call the police!!
Help me!!!	Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
I told you I'm looking for someone.	In the cars, too?!
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.	It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.	I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.	Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.	It was only an accident that we discovered them.
To the same woman?	Yes.
Where are you going?	Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?	I don't understand.
Is there a reward in this?	Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?	I wouldn't think so.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.	If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.	Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?	No problem.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.	You're too goddamned paranoid.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?	A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
You said you were going to get her out of this.	Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.	I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
He has his uses too.	What?  He gonna record you on his label?
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.	Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.	Can't do it.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.	Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Who did it?	Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.	Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--	Shutup a second!
Let's work it.	Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.	I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.	I intend to.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.	Where's Faith?
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.	And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.	Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.	Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.	Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.	Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'	She never gave me a tape.
I always do.	Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.	They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.	Mace!  You're a life-saver.
What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.
I thought we were friends.	No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.	Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
What is it?	Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Blackjack?  I don't understand--	Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.	I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.	So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.	Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
And what about the guy that was following me?	Now you're really getting paranoid.
How's Zander?	OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?	Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Lenny, give them the tape.	It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Shit!	Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Those two guys were cops.	You sure?
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.	Well, look at the plus side.
There's a plus side?	Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...	Yeah, right, blow it open.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--	Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.	You never told me.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.	No, it's not.
Got your ticket?	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
You see Tran?	Uh unh.
Alright.  We're going up.	And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.	See you downtown.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.	Aw, Mom!
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.	Take the tape to the cops.
Was this him?	Um... he was older.
Testa?	The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?	Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?	No, sir.
Agent Mackelway.	Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.	What's the bad news?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.	Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Hi there.	I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You have the body?	She's buried.
A grill pattern.	We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.	This is Agent Mackelway.
There seems to be a discrepancy.	Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.	It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You... surprised me.	Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.	You must travel a lot, huh?
Yeah.	Whole country or just hereabouts?
What?	About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.	What are you doing?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.	Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.	This better be important.
Its called insubordination.	Then why do I still have a badge?
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.	You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.	How long ago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?	An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.	I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?	I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.	There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
You are so fucked up.	Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Thanks for the ride.	They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?	The Academy, then CIIAC.
Doesn't fit.	This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Yes I do.	It explains a lot.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.	The man knew how to dress.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.	I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
What's that?	Sex.
Look at this fellow... or this one.	Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.	I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
It's a no-no.	I know.
I've been thinking about this.	Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.	What did you tell him?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.	No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.	You did.
And nobody else can do that?	Not the way I can.
Hello?	Jaime? Where are you?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.	I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.	Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I'd be real careful if I were you.	It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
But why this pattern?	Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Tom, you okay?	Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?	Yeah, of course.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.	How are we going to find him?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.	No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.	I'll be back.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.	I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
What was your weakness, sir?	I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Suspect Zero?	Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.	Zero killed them all?
[Reality very risky.]	Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Lionheart, what happened?]	Something came up, Murman, my man.
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]	Lead the way, Murman.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]	Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?	[You tell me.]
I want to go live with you.	[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.	[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Yes, sir.	What did you do to end up here?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.	Sounds like fun.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?	I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.	This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
But why attack an Agent?	He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
I don't think you understand.	What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
You have to put things in perspective.	I know, I know.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...	Enough. I've got to use the phone.
How are you ladies doing this evening?	What do you drive?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...	I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Are you sure? Maybe...	Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Like the quiche?	Yes. Like the quiche.
I like quiche.	I thought real men don't like quiche.
What else?	What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?	Uh, if the guy wants to.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?	No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...not until you book it...	...and even then...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.	What an asshole.
Let me just check on my boy.	Don't worry. He's in good hands.
He's so sweet. He really said that?	I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.	No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
You have to lay it on the table.	Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Why not?	There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Well, who represents you back east?	Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.	I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
It's a rebound.	We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
I'll have to come see you sometime.	If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...Which one...?	...The red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...	...get the hell outta here already...
Hello?	Hi, Mike?
How's it going? It's been a while...	...Six months.
Good.  I think about things.	Yeah?
Yeah.	What kind of things?
You know, us.	I thought you met someone else.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.	Really?
Hi.	I heard you might be moving back...
So I don't call either way.	Right.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.	Thanks. Thanks, man.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.	What do you want? You're tall.
I didn't mention her once today.	Well, until now. Tend the pin.
You want to hit the town tonight?	I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
How many strokes?	I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight. 	What'd you get?
An eight.	Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
Kinda money, huh?	Classy.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 	Bud.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.	I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.	Ah, there's the rub...
Oh, like that song...	..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Then why won't she call...?	Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?	Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.	You always know the right thing to say.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.	So, what? Eleven?
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...	...People get carjacked...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...	...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 	Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 	I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.	Hang on, Voltaire.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.	I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Wake up, baby.	Whu?
They're all skanks.	Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
Cut that shit out.	She smiled baby.
It doesn't matter...	I'm telling you, they love that shit.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.	What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Always, baby.	I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.	Yea, how much?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.	Let's go.
What an asshole.	That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.	Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I don't think so.	Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
That's bullshit.	It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...	...gotta...
No, man. I need to use the phone.	What?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?	You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Christy was nice...	I didn't even like her, to be honest.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.	Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.	Michelle went for you, right.
I hear she's getting real fat.	Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
You guys are such assholes.	Aww... He got away?
What time's this party tonight?	It starts at eight...
Was I money?	I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?	No, baby!
How long do I wait to call?	A day.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.	Oh. He's got it under control...
Oh, it's on, baby...	...It's on.
Is she looking now?	No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.	True.
...we're not...	You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.	Now go over there and get those digits.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.	Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Sue...	Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
It's on...	...it's on.
It's on.	...it's definitely on.
Sorry man.	Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.	Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?	Yes. 
No.  You ask for too much.	I ask for Justice.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.	America has been good to me...
Be my friend.	Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Eat it, it's on the table.	Ba Fa Goulle.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?	No, just you and Paulie.
You take care of Paulie?	You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.	We gotta move...
Outside.	Sure.
I'll think about it.	Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
Good for ten men...	OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
You think we'll go for that last place?	Maybe, or you gotta know now.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.	It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Is it necessary?	You understand him better than anyone.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?	Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?	Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.	Maybe I can help.
What was this for?	For bravery.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.	I'll need him.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?	Yes.
Godfather, you understand everything.	Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Don Tommassino.	Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
I know.	Where are you going?
Corleone.	There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
What is it?	Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.	Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Hey, beautiful girls!	Shhhhh.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.	You look good, too.
Mike!  The party starting!	Come here a minute, Fredo.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.	Okay.  One minute.
Is the hospital covered?	The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?	Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.	We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Will you give this letter to Michael.	Mama, no.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.	Thanks Tom.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.	Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?	Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Then Luca turned to the other man...	Michael, I love you.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.	How do you do.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?	My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?	No.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.	My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.	I'm busy.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.	Don't ask me.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.	Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.	You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?	Thanks.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.	You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.	You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.	Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
What? What?	Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Hi Tom.	Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.	Did you speak to my father?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.	Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I met him in New York.	Marge! You've got to hear this!
I'm never going back!	No, I think your mother, her illness --
Good afternoon!	What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Could we sail to Venice?	Sure. I love Venice.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.	A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
I know. I write like a child.	Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?	No!
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?	I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
Esatto. I'm always planning.	Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.	I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Ha.	Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.	I love Marge.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --	What evening?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.	I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
I'm well, thank you.	Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.	Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?	He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.	I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.	Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.	I'm sure we've met.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?	Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?	Frances?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.	What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.	Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?	No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Is he really not here?	Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.	Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.	No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
I was looking forward to seeing him.	Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Did Dickie's Dad go?	He's having an early night.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.	Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.	What are you going to do now, Tom?
I told you! I knew it!	Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.	No glasses.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!	I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
What's your secret?	Excuse me?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.	As in the...?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.	Randall.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?	What?
Let's go.	I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.	You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.	Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
My God.	But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.	Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.	What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?	Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.	You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Do you want me to stick around?	It's okay.
Hello. What are you up to?	All kinds of things. Making plans.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?	I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.	Peter, I... I...
And don't forget. I have the key.	You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?	Postmortem?
Can we go up? Do you mind?	Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.	Even your fiancée...?
Thank you.	May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?	I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Nah, this'll be fine.	You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Is there a firing range around?	Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
You want to canvass?	Yes, mam.
I don't know...	It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.	I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.	I can believe that.
Where do you live?	Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?	I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
What did you do?	I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
That's really something.	Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.	No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?	Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?	I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.	Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You know what you remind me of?	What?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 	I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
The singer?	Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?	Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
So you haven't heard this record yet?	No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.	Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.	Thank you, Travis.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.	The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.	Have you been noticing anything strange?
No, why?	Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Oh, are you all right?	I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No, why?	You sure he's not Italian?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.	Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?	I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.	Show me how he did that again.
What is your name? My name is Travis.	Awh, come off it, Pal.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.	What did you do?
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...	One-Ball McCall?
Fuckin' One-Ball.	And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
Stick up?	No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.	In the jungle. 122nd.
Well... I guess so.	All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
What's your real name?	I don't like my real name.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?	Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Do they drug you?	Oh, come off it, man.
Don't you want to go?	I can leave anytime I want.
Can I see you again?	That's not hard to do.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.	Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.	Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
How?	I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.	I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Sure you don't want to come with me?	I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Nice talking to you, Travis.	Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?	No Sir.
No, I want long shifts.	We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
No.	Well then check back tomorrow.
Are you a Secret Service Man?	Why do you ask?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.	Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Anything you say, officer.	I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.	Shit.
I'm no cop.	Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
I'm hip.	Funny, you don't look hip. 
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.	That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.	Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Stick with Carla.	Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Thank you.	You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
He says he's leaving the island sir.	Don't let him do that.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.	Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Well yes I suppose ...	You suppose?
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....	Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
Limp dick?	It's all I could think of.
Mason.  Mason?	It's about time.
Partners?	Partners.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.	What's that?  Mason?
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?	Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?	Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
What about you, Delly?	I am, too.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.	I wish you were coming with me.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?	Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...	Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
I think  it's worse  now.	That always used to work.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.	You mean,  me?
Do you... remember me?	I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Me too.	You look... different.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.	How'd they get it inside?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?	Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...	Oh...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?	What?
Nine hundred...	Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Well, there's got to be a way...	Have you got a cigarette?
When did you start smoking?	I don't smoke?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.	Oh.
Huh.  That was nice of me.	You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Now, did you remember that, or...	Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Sir, that is true.	Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.	Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Yes it does.	Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?	Start with what you knew then.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?	I'm not refuting anything.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?	I do.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?	I... I need a drink of water.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.	What's that?
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.	Thanks.
Wait'll you see the inside!	Can't wait.
This is the staff of the Bijou.	Oh.  What... what time is it?
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.	You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?	They're...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?	Oh, no, I...
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...	Dad, I...
Luke... what time is it?	Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?	You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Zackly.	Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.	You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.	Pete...
Any idea how you got here, son?	No, sir.
What is it?	Call me... Ishmael?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?	What's his rent?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.	At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.	Yeah, well, that's enough.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.	What do you mean?
Please, sit.	Thanks.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.	Oh...
Ancestors?	Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
I suppose.  Thanks.	You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?	Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?	No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I don't understand.	Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.	No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
I see.	So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I did.	Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
And the second?	I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.	In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Yes, I did.	Just listen to them!
Could I have a puff?	I don't think your mother would like that.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?	I don't know yet.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.	I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?	She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?	Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.	That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Mitch, let's turn back.	Shhh. Shhhhh.
And the white house?	That's where the Brenners live.
I see. How do I get down there?	Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Thank you.	Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
How much for the phone calls?	It's nothing.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.	Birds are not bad!
One apple pie! You want more coffee?	No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?	I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Across at Brinkmeyer's.	Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Whose side are you on?	I'm simply quoting the law.
How long have you known her?	I told you. We met yesterday.
She was selling birds.	No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.	I know, Mother.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...	Mother?
Yes?	I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Mother, get a rope!	Oh, my God, look at her!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.	You're doing fine.
We won't be here.	Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'll worry about that when we get there.	I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.	Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
No.	I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.	Yes.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.	Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I couldn't ask you to.	I don't mind, really.
That's a chimney swift, all right.	We know what it is, Al.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...	We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Is that for Mitch Brenner?	Yes.
Well, where did he go?	Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Well... yes, sir, there are.	These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I understand completely, sir.	As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.	The sign says strawberry finches.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 	Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.	I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Some of them are.	How can you tell?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...	Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?	Yes.
Can't see a thing.	I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Certainly, but...	Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
With... with Annie, of course.	Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Will I be seeing you again?	San Francisco's a long way from here.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?	I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?	I wrote the letter.
What did it say?	It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
But you tore it up.	Yes.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.	Cheers.
I have several jobs.	What do you do?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.	I'm glad you do.
Last night? What do you mean?	A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It smelled of the fire.	It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?	At Annie's house. She's all right.
I keep thinking of Annie. 	It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Where are they heading?	Inland.
Santa Rosa?	Maybe.
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
The power.	Mitch...
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.	You said three o'clock.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...	Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?	I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Yes, certainly. 	Do you have any lovebirds?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?	Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I don't know why.	I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?	No one called it a war!
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?	I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.	No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Help how? What do you want to do?	I'm not sure, but...
I'm only a student.	Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
You have his promise, then?	Yes.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.	Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --	But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --	MacFarlane
He's not home.	Where can I find him?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?	From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?	Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.	You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But you did promise.	Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.	Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --	Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?	He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
See that, Fettes?	A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?	He was a nice horse.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.	Don't call me that confounded name.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.	Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.	Afraid of what?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.	I am the best man for the job.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.	You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?	The nerve centers -- the brain --
But why, Gray? Why?	Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
What did you hear?	I know --
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.	We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.	I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Was the paralysis immediate?	No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
Crony indeed!	You can get out.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?	I'll get him.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?	Tell her... we'll get him.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.	You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.	There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
Fucking Zombie.	The scar.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.	How can you die if you're already dead?
You killed that cop Dutton.	And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
No...	... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
No. You don't.	Yes I do, I really do.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...	My father.
It's ok, it's ok...	It's not. I can't take it.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.	I know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.	Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Guy dressed for Halloween?	Good for you. You do know something.
They botched the execution.	Could say that.
An accident, Nathan.	She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
You want me to walk a straight line?	I want you... to bend over.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.	Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
What is it?	The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
It still doesn't mean...	He said he'd prove it.
I think I dropped an earring.	Looks like you have them both on.
You're in with them.	It's not what you think.
Stay away from me! Stay away!	Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
They killed her because she found out.	About you.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.	My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.	We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.	I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
Such power exists?	I assure you such power exists.
Hi Mom!	Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter	Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?	No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.	No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Are you an FBI man?	No -- I'm afraid not.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.	He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.	Where is that?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?	Yes -- I think so.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.	Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think they'll ever find him?	I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?	Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
What does that mean?	It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Go to the movies.	All right.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.	Why not, Bobby?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.	We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.	Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?	Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?	Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
I don't believe it.	Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
How does he explain that?	He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.	I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--	This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.	I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.	Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
Well, we could--	There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.	I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?	All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!	I don't care about the rest of the world!
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.	Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.	Where is the meeting going to be?
But how -- how long--?	How long will I live?  That no one can say.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?	He'll catch on to it in no time now.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?	No -- I'm afraid not.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.	They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.	How long will that take?
May I suggest that you call the Professor?	Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!	We don't ride with vampires.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.	El Vampiro.
Should I run him through?	I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
Shut up!	We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Don't!  Stop!	Why?  They're only noodles.
What's going' on?	What's goin' on, Marko?
Where is she?!	Hey, take it easy.
With him?	Yeah.
Leave him alone.	Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!	That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Oh, no...	What?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!	Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!	Closet monster!?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.	Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.	I better get cleaned up, then.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?	Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Ocean air!	Smells like something died.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.	Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.	No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --	-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Ohmygod...	Mom!
Not impressed, are you?	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.	I hear this is the decade for cute.
This looks terrific, Lucy.	Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
I'm really sorry, Max.	Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.	I hope so.
Something the matter?	No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.	I thought you said they needed discipline?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?	Okay.
Ouch.	Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
You've got to put this on.	Take laddie.
It's gone.  I feel it!	So do I!
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.	Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
You're beautiful.	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Where are we going?	Nowhere.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!	Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?	Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.	Piss off.
Michael?	Don't turn on the light.
What??	Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.	I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?	I don't know.
Sixteen.	And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?	I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...	If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
What you doin'?	Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
How you doin', old boy?	I don't know who to trust.
Somebody broke in.	Now who'd go and do...
Childs!!	Let go of me...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!	Was dark... find a light...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!	I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
MacReady!	Look, I'm just guessing...
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.	I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.	That's good enough.
Torch them!!	But...
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.	What for?
Would that test have worked?	I think so.
Now hold him.	I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.	Nothing we can do about that.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.	And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.	Well, stick to it.
Put that down!	No.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.	Damn if I won't.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.	Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
What's...	Blair.  He's gone berserk.
What if it doesn't come?	It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
This storm do that?	Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...	Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
Get back!!	The generator!
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.	So what do you make of it?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.	Who else could have used that key?
You hear that?	Hear what?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!	Can't hear you.
Ah... no.	Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?	We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
Sir... have you a name?	I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.	Can you show us where they live?
Send him away.	What?
Yes...	It was meant to.
Vox?	This way.
Why did they built it?	The Morlocks didn't build this.
This has to end.	End...?
You took her because she helped me.	Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.	A man can change his history.
May I help you?	I -- what are you?!
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
Admiration?  My my.	I mean... well... affection.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.	And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Darling.	I need... to talk to you.
All right...	Not here... alone.  Please.
Let's walk through the park...	No... let's walk through the city.
Alex...?!	Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --	The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Heavens, look at that now!	I've seen it.
Alex... people are staring.	Let them.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.	Tonight's the night?
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?	I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.	That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
That's absurd --	You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.	I don't understand.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --	Yes...
His curiosity is amazing.	Mm.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.	You're not from beyond the valley.
That machine --	Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Is he all right?	Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
You seem fascinated by the stars.	You can see so many here.
Yes.	And you saw a shape ahead of you...
This is magnificent...	Thank you.
This is where my journey started... right here.	You lost someone.
Kalen...	Mara...?
Oh, I'm already swooning.	Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Yes, sir, he --	Tell him to go away --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.	May I get you some --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?	Exactly correct, sir.
And roosters.	No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
My equations are not parlor-tricks!	Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
He said he traveled for two months.	I took a different route.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.	New Yorkers.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!	That's quite enough, Kalen.
We'll see about that.	I am.  Are you a climber?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --	They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.	Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?	For our sake, I hope not.
Should we be...	Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?	Depends on what you're seeing.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.	In where?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.	That wasn't a fucking restraint.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.	Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.	I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
And what's that?	My business?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?	You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
Who are you?	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.	I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.	No, we were patients.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.	He didn't either.
We're late.	I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?	I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.	His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...	Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Your mom take anything before this happened?	Yeah, but I don't know what.
But I like it I guess.	Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
I think I can remember what's on them.	William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.	What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
How'd he die?	I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?	Yeah.
[Beat] You bled to death.	What?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?	No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I don't believe a thing she just said.	Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.	Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Me, too.	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
They're not here.	They're not.
What? What are you thinking?	There're no cars on this street.
Then why isn't there anyone around?	[Beat] I don't know.
They've got lives to be grateful for.	William, you're not making sense.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.	No, he didn't.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?	Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
I think so.	You're bleeding pretty bad there.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?	It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.	I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
What case?	I was working with a boy named Eugene.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?	How do you know about Dr. Becker?
You don't understand.	Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?	It doesn't look all that different.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.	I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.	Who told you this?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?	Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.	Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.	[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.	I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Can you drive?	Sure.
No.	Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?	Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.	I'll manage.
This is a great song.	You remember it?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?	May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Hon.	What.
You want anything special for dinner?	No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Honey?	Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?	I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?	I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?	In the leg.
Who do you think did it?	Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.	You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.	Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Alright.	Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Is this the guy you saw them with?	It's him.
What kind of gun was it?	A .38.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.	He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.	It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Louise, is that you?	Thelma?  It's me.
Well, I guess I'd better...	Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?	I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
What did ya do?	I'm a robber.
Hey, peaches.	Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?	Why now, Jimmy?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.	Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.	You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.	Okay.  I will, too.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.	How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.	Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.	Isn't this fun?
Thelma!	Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.	Yeah!
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?	Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.	I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Oh my God.	Get the car.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.	Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.	Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
It means shut up, Thelma.	So this is all my fault, is it.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?	What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.	Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?	Why are you actin' like this?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?	Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.	I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...	I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
So what are you gonna tell him?	Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
What happened to your hair?	Nothing.  It got messed up.
Holy shit.	Lemme see the map.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!	Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?	Try to.
Thelma.	Yeah.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!	You're right.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?	Yeah.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.	Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
What?!	Harlan.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.	About how fast was I going?
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.	I believe you.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.	Just asking.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.	It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
What?	That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
I said all that?	No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Thelma, that is not an option.	But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
You awake?	You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.	We can change our names.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.	You're drivin'.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!	It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.	Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
What?!  What d'you think?!	Oh.
You're a good friend.	You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.	How do you stay so positive?
What in the hell is that up there?	Where?!
Go.	Go?
We been seein' you all along the way.	Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You women are crazy!	You got that right.
We're fine!  How are you?	Grrrreat!
Where you goin'?	Fresno.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.	The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.	No, I just meant...
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?	Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?	You sent that?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.	Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.	Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Nah.	Never?
I mean since then.	I don't know.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?	I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
You're kidding? What did they say?	They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I don't know about this, Dom.	Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Never met him.	Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Got cash.	Car clean? Plenty of gas?
You know, clean the pipes.	Pipes? What are you talking about?
Why's that?	I'm usually too tired to be.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.	But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Uh-huh. Where was he?	Out getting coffee.
Who?	Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.	'That right?
We're in love with your roommate.	Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?	Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Very nice.	I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.	What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.	You found my car?!
So where the hell are you, Healy?	Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Oh yeah.	Dumbshit.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.	You own a home there?
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?	Some buildings I'm working on.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.	That sounds like fun.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?	Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?	Great.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?	We will, but first I have a surprise.
I know he's around here someplace.	What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?	That...? Vestibule.
How about -- ?	When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.	Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Lint?	Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.	Have you seen it?
I guess.	Well, I'll see ya.
Mary ah, forget it.	What?
Are you okay?	Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
All you want is a phone number?	Well, I know you're busy...
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.	Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.	You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.	So she hasn't changed?
Nope. Never been.	Huh?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?	It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Miami?	Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.	Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Mary's a mail-order bride?	Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?	I don't know what you're talking about.
Among others.	Kim and I are close friends!
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.	You mean him.
You know, I really should take your card.	Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?	Who?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!	But... but you knew people at Harvard.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!	Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
I'd go with the seven.	Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.	What's that supposed to mean?
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.	I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?	These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Good lookin'?	He's no Steve Young.
Holy shit...	Puffy, get over here.
Magda!	The little shit lied to me about that guy!
He's a nice guy, isn't he?	Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.	Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
By the way, how's he doing?	He's dead.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.	Oh... are you... ?
You look great.	Thanks.
Now by killer, you mean...?	I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...	Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.	No short game.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.	What are you?
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.	I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Ted... you're not that far ahead.	Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
What what are you doing here?	You forgot your keys!
Yeah? What do you want?	Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Is it the frank or the beans?	I think a little of both.
One guess.	How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.	No, that's really unneces --
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?	Giddy-up.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.	We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.	With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?	Yes, sir.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?	Yes.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.	So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.	Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.	We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.	We've got bigger problems right now.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.	McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.	He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Oh, still sore about this.	Something your father would've come up with.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --	-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.	No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --	-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
How long until the army is ready?	We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?	Still heading for Cuba.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.	Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.	He was.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.	Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
So what've we got today?	Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.	Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!	You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.	Okay, Ken. We're going.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.	Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.	Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.	And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...	Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Bob?	We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.	Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.	Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?	Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Mr. Clear Moon.	Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.	Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.	FBI? What you investigatin'?
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.	The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?	Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?	No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.	Good. Thank you.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.	Goodbye.
What the hell you doing?!	His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Were you in Nam?	Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.	I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
What'd she say?	She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.	Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...	I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
I'll sleep around a little.	Thanks, Cooch.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.	Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Tread matches. It's the car.	Yes.
Jesus, you alright?	Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.	We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
What?!	You're steppin' on sign.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --	Bullshit.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --	-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.	Medicine. As in medicine man?
What did he say?	He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.	Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.	I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
That's not solid.	You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?	Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.	A what?
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.	You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.	I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...	Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.	Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.	Sorry.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?	Yeah. Fitful dreams.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.	We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.	What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...	I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
What?	Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?	Come back?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.	Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --	-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.	At Sioux Falls Pen?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.	I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
I'll bet!	Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
How so?	Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Where did you see that?	It's classified.
The what?	You know. The finger.
What would?	You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.	I'm special.
Lieutenant...	Evan... or Maverick.
Why'd you do that?	
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.	You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.	Why?
No.	What do you want?
You don't believe that.	Hardly ever.
Want to play the game?	How does it go?
Goose is dead.	True.
Looks like a tie.	Who's gonna win?
Well... What   is   it?	Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Tomcats?	Yes sir!
Can't shake him.	WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.	It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
That's missile lock!	He better be kidding!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?	These guys are getting on my nerves.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.	You.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?	DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
What are you doing?	Saving them some paperwork.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!	Not anymore.
Ohhh Mother!	Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?	Roger, I've got it.
You're not supposed to...	But I have to!
What do you want?	Any more MiGs?
Let me do the talking.	Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Well, I don't know. That depends.	On what?
You ever done this before?	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?	Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!	Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.	I've had enough...for now.
What the hell is this?	Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
What what are you doing? We're cover!	Wood's okay. I want Viper.
I was a victim of circumstance.	They should have warned you about that one.
Mav's a great flyer but....	He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.	That's because you don't have any women.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.	SHIT!!
GET LOST!	YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
I've seen this before.	So have I.
Who's the hell is that?	Three guesses.
Helping him in.	What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
You didn't help.	No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.	Then why are you here?
I called your house.	My wife's house.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.	I'm nothing like him.
So, where to?	The Last Resort.
What happened to number five?	Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.	How'd you find me?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.	Thank you.
Would you like the same suite?	Definitely.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.	Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.	Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.	Don't be an idiot.
Kill him.	It's about goddamn time.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.	Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Your sexual orientation?	Hetero.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.	Sleazy...and demure.
What do you want?	This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.	I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"	That's right.
Suppose I do...then what?	Swallow this.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.	Any news of Quaid?
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.	This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Pull them out.	O.K., everybody pull out!
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.	We don't have much choice then, do we?
They sell fake memories.	Oh, Rekall.
No shit...	Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.	Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I want that fucker dead.	I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	I've got Quaid.
I've got a lock!  There!	Come on!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?	Drive!  DRIVE!!
Let's do it.	Do what?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.	Lori, move.
Well...What do you say?	I'm late.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.	Bye.
What are you doing?	Some men just tried to kill me!
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...	You went to those brain butchers?!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!	Doug...
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.	I'm honored.
As real as any memory in your head.	Come on, don't bullshit me.
All right.	Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I'm not interested in that.	You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?	Blondes.
She wasn't really my wife.	Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
What can I do?	Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Like what?	All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.	Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
What's wrong?	I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?	No problem.
Yeah, like they got a plan...	Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...	Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.	Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Knock it off, Burt!	I think I scared it!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.	We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
What the hell you doing back already?	You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!	What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.	Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!	Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
BACK OFF, BURT...!	Well, who put you two in charge?
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.	I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.	Howdy, Rhonda.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.	Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?	Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.	Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Jeez, look at that guy.	One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Oh, Jesus!!	What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?	Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.	Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
What the hell are they?	Sons of bitches!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.	Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Well, folks, what's the plan?	First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!	Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?	Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Its tires are flat...	Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.	You are so full of shit...
Hi, guys, what you been up to?	Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Ready?	Yeah.  One, two, three...
I brought it... to the coroner.	An hour after you picked it up!
You're fishing. You don't know shit.	I know about Esparza.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?	Absolutely.
Gimme back my bottle.	Let go of my hair.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!	Sustained.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?	I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.	I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --	-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?	Shut your sewer mouth!
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?	I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Come now. Did you see the gun?	I can describe it.
How can you remember that?	I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.	Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
You see that? You wanna be like that?	No. No...
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.	Of course.
Ten years is a long time.	Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
What other case?	Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.	Saving it for the Sunday Times.
Eddie Dowd.	Roger Baron.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!	That's why I hate experts.
-- Eddie...	You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!	That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...	I'm not that desperate.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.	Christ... Shu is innocent.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?	... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?	-- Me? Neither.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.	Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
A fucking wheelchair?	I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
-- Find him?	Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
No. You tell me, Shu.	How can I tell you what I don't know!
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.	When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
'lo, Cecil.	See-cil.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?	I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.	It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --	Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.	Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
You're pissing me off again, Ed.	You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?	Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?	Objection.
In those days, they often worked as a team.	And who was Arturo Esparza?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.	I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?	-- Eddie told you?
It's okay. It was always like that.	Shouldn't one of us...?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?	-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.	And its purpose?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.	I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?	Shu's the only one I know of...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --	No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
What color hair will she have?	Blonde.
Go away. I am not talking to you.	I want you.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.	Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No.	I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.	I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.	Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?	Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.	You're lucky I am not wasting you.
It's 4:30. We close at five.	We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.	We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.	Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.	Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.	I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Phillip?	COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?	Teresa Banks.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.	ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
He's dead -- good and dead.	Sorry to hear it.
No.	Did she ever mention any friends?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.	Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.	Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
A blue rose.	Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?	He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.	Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.	I think that's a good idea.
Take a look at this.	She's wearing a ring.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?	He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
James called me last night looking for you.	When?
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?	I don't know what to do.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...	You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.	I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Are you going to see James tonight?	Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.	You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?	Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Goodbye, Muffin.	No, you're the muffin.
You're not mad at me?	No.
But I love you, Laura.	And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
The pages are gone. That's real.	Maybe.
Did you make me a tape?	I already made you two tapes.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.	Hey, Jacques...
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...	What? She asked about my father?
We're on our way, Baby.	Let's go all the way.
Laura, do you love me?	Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
You always hurt the ones you love.	You mean the ones you pity.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.	I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
You'd think so.	Sex?
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.	They were looking for wood.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.	Fish eyes?
Can I take the car?	Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura.	What?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.	What were you doing in my room?
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?	Mom... what are you wearing?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.	It's a school night... back by nine.
Good night, Mom.	Good night, sweetheart.
Dad.	Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?	Not really.
Who was that?	A friend from school.
Did you get this from your lover?	They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?	How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?	Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.	Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
I don't know.	That's right.
He was accused of jury tampering.	Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.	All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?	Yes.
Yes.	Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.	Yes. It would be.
That's not my handwriting.	You've just said you signed it.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?	After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
Neurology?	No.
...of Anesthesiology?	'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...	...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Objection!	And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...	I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
Anything special about the case?	When she...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...	What did these people do when her heart stopped?
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?	Yes.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...	I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?	Hold on a second.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.	Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?	Well...
I'm sorry...?	Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Do you know who her doctors were?	I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?	To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi.	Hi. How are you doing?
One hour.	Yes.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?	My client can't walk, your Honor.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.	...things change.
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
I had a witness disappear on me.	That happens.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.	Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?	If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Listen to me, fella...	No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Maybe I can do something right.	And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
I've got to work...	Do you want me to go...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.	Who told you that?
Continental Casualty...	Mr. Alito, please.
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...	...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I can't guarantee that...	I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
Hello, I'm calling from...	If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Pardon?	Kathy Price.
We find that your subscription lapsed...	My subscription lapsed three years ago...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?	...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
You know what happened.	Nothing happened.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.	And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.	I didn't do it, Mister.
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?	It's locked.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...	...I understand...
Well, well, well. Huh?	Yeah.
...he's a good man...	...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.	Admittance form is wrong.
Right.	Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what?	So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
How are you holding up?	I'm swell.
What are you doing in New York...?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...	Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...	Yes.
...they start again three minutes earlier...	We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...	Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.	Huh. And why is that?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	Huh.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.	Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!	I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
Hurry up!  Jump in!	There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Did you see it come down?	Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.	Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
Aw, he isn't that good...!	How can you say that when you don't know him!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.	I didn't know how to stop you...!
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.	Don't you live at home?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.	I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.	It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.	But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.	I liked him.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!	But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
How long was I out?	Hours.  I've been so scared...!
What was it like?	I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
How'd you guess?	That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...	You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!	It might give us something.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?	It was nearer than that.
What'll we say to 'em?	Welcome to California!
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.	Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
Which means he's having nightmares again?	He's very excited about it.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.	What?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?	You get any sleep last night?
No, you don't.	Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
What if it isn't over?	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Heather?	Chase. Hi...
Someone's coming.	What?
Rex saved me.	Rex?  Who's Rex?
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.	Finish, please!
He's on his way.	He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.	Not sleepy.
In my bed.	Your bed?
You okay, champ?	Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.	Read me some?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.	It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
You're not crazy, by the way.	Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Seemed, not was.	It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
I've never mentioned it to him.	Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
You got it.  What's happening?	Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!	John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
I want to see the body.	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?	Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Captured?  How?	By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.	Choice?  What kind of choice?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.	And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
He would have loved this.	Your father?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.	You miss him.
What?	He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
What are they doing?	Claiming their place in the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...	Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."	Give me some time to Blow the man down!
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.	Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Carry on.	Yes sir.
But your instinct was to lose sail?	My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.	Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
There's still a way.	What do you mean?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?	No, I can't.
She isn't that old.	What do you mean?
Yeah.	My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?	If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.	Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
You okay?	Yeah.  How'd you do.
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.	What was that?
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.	I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?	I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Why then.	Because it looks good.
He does.	You don't give him enough credit Chas.
Why'd you do it?	What's the difference?
Do you have your ticket?	Yes.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.	I know you will.
What the hell is going on?	Maybe it's an air raid.
So... What happened?	My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.	Yes sir.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.	Face what?
Uh, huh.	Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.	So is violating international law.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.	Twice.
Is that what you were trained to do?	No.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.	As you can see, there's a lot to do.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.	It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.	And, of course, we are.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.	Why are you here?
Oh, really?	Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
And being sixteen.	They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
What's that?	They'll know about it in the morning.
Jesus.  She's got guns.	She's Cuban.
What's your problem?	Why'd you jump?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?	I couldn't do it.
How would you know?	Trust me donut.  I know.
What?  Come on...	On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Why, man?	I don't have to listen to this.
Tie it off!!	Outer.
Do you have something to say?	No.
No, sir.	Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
What's it going to be?	I'm sorry...
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...	Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Yes.	Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.	This be it?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.	We don't have no paper bags.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?	You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.	Get out.
Need a hand?	Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.	Ready for another?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.	She really say she was pregnant?
What'd you say?	No, of course.
Gas?	Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Club Zanzibar.	You say it's straight ahead a mile?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.	Thanks.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.	Sounds right... I'll check it out.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.	Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.	Muchas gracias.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?	Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.	She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.	Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?	Why not? How was the fishin'?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?	Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.	Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.	This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?	No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.	Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.	That bastard Pucinski...
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.	How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.	Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.	And?
Hey baby...	Peanut...
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.	Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...	Here she goes again...
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.	That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
Actin' funny how?	Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Sailor!	You up for that?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.	Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.	That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.	Got anyplace special in mind?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.	Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
What's that, honey?	There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.	Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?	It's just another case, Sailor.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?	Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
I do.	I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?	Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
You ready for this?	We'll find out in a hurry.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?	Uh huh.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?	Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
More'n likely.	I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.	Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.	That'd be good, Lula.
What's that, peanut?	I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.	We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...	My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
It's a comfortin' idea.	Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
Sailor?	Yeah?
Sailor? You know what?	I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.	Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?	Went with Bobby.
Let's leave here.	We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.	We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!	Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.	Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Six.	Got any plans?
Wouldn't make any difference.	What if I told you not to?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.	I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Just tell me what you want.	I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Simple? Kill him? How?	That's your business... I don't care how.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?	Santos...
Explain it... I told you.	Shoot him.
Where? In the leg?	No.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?	No... But...
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...	Santos... I can't...
What?...	...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...	So?
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?	I didn't see nothin'...
I ain't heard of nothin'.	Thanks...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.	Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Actually... I just want to go home.	Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?	We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?	The candelabras were my Gran's.
You all right, Professor Tripp?	He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.	Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
You snore.	So I hear.
It's the Chancellor.	Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...	I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??	It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Trip??	She left me. Crabs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?	This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?	Shut up and drink.
Not Curtis.	Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.	He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.	And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.	Because... because...
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.	Tripp.
Wait here. I'll be right back.	Where would we go?
You stay there.	What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
James? My James? What's happened?	Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Crabtree.	Ye-es?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.	Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.	No wonder he screwed us over.
Came to my senses.	Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
No. But I don't think that matters.	That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
No...	I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.	I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
I've been doing that a lot lately.	So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
She told you about...	Her dog, yes.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.	They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?	'Fraid so.
You cold, James?	A little.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...	Heaven?
They're glass. The buttons.	Like the lady herself.
Can I ask you something about her?	She is. Ah. Here we go...
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.	No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.	I guess there's probably a story behind that.
The guy on the phone.	What'd he say?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.	Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
But... ?	Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
How's that?	Well done, James.
Outside Scranton.	I never heard of it.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?	Kinship.
It feels really... good... here.	I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.	I never said that.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.	Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I'm not going, with them.	James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Get out of here.	That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Professor Tripp...?	Yes, James.
So what are you going to do?	Do?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?	At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?	I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.	That good, huh?
I got the message you called.	I got the message you called too.
And? Are you going to tell him?	No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.	I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Not have it.	No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
You heard? How?	A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?	Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
What's he doing out there?	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
Sara.	I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?	I think I might have.
And what do you think you might have said?	I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I went and looked at some babies just now.	Oh?
Did you tell Walter?	I told Walter.
Does he still love you?	It didn't come up.
Did you just make that up?	In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Listen, Antonia --	Tony. Now that I'm home.
Who's this ?	It's Grady, Walter.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?	I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?	Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Do you get high, Sam?	Only when I'm working.
Holy shit. Are you serious?	As a heart attack.
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.	Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."	Give me a break, Grady.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!	Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Hey, is that a school?	K through sixth.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.	It's a nice table.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.	It wasn't like that.
Soon.	Next week? The week after?
It's not what you think.	Isn't it?
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.	You don't have to tell me this.
What are you looking at?	Birds.
There's a million birds here.	In that birch tree is a nest.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?	Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
See anything interesting?	Not yet.
I would.	Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?	I could get a search warrant.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.	They grow outside, don't they?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.	Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
What?	Would you like to sit on my lap?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?	They sound like finches.
Yes.	Do you like it when he asks you?
What's her name?	Ms. Kramer.
But will he... ?	Your daddy will always love you.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?	I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.	That was a joke.
Why not?	Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.	Of course.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.	I don't need someone else.
Do you think you're crazy?	If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Why do you think you're here?	You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
I mean, when will I be normal.	We have a lot of work to do.
Will I ever be normal?	I couldn't say.
I want to be normal!	Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.	I want to talk about it now.
You're very late.	Sorry.
And what are you doing?	Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you get an erection?	I was six years old!
What?	Are you okay?
Doesn't it get noisy?	I like the noise.
I'm not easily shocked.	I get that impression.
Hey, that was... intense.	You're still here.
Tell me about it.	Maybe later.
Did I say something wrong?	I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?	When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
What's the worst thing you ever did?	The worst?
You're not joking.	Twelve years in prison is no joke.
What was prison like?	You don't really --
You really believe that?	No. That's what I used to tell myself.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.	Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
What's this?	What's it look like?
What's going on?	Nothing.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.	Piece of cake, baby.
Nice shot, Lins.	What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?	Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
You never did like being called that, did you?	Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?	Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
You wanna know what I think?	Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
What are you still wearing that for?	I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
I haven't worn mine in months.	Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
What happened?	Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
Fine.  Be that way.	I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.	If you say so.  It could be anything.
I think it likes you.	It's trying to communicate.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.	They'll come out after us.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.	How?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.	Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--	NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...	What's the plan?
Oh God, Lins... I--	Tell me later.
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?	'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.	Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.	Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?	Got it. Over.
He's convulsing!	It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.	Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.	Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Quiet!  Quiet!	Turn it up, bozo.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.	We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.	Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.	He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.	Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
What kind of light?	He's hallucinating badly.
Used to what?	To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
And have you any other truths to tell me?	You already know what they are.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.	It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.	I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?	It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Well?	Well, what?
Have you decided?	All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Find anything?	No.
Yes, you should go.	But then when will we see each other?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.	But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...	And why did you drop them?
Why are you looking at me like that?	I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Claudia, let's get married?	What! Get married?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...	And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.	Why?
I'm too sleepy.	Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
But where did you finally end up?	It was futile. We went all over.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?	I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.	But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.	Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Please, you come too...	But for what reason should I come there?
I'll stay here also.	But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.	So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
And who is this?	This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Ettore...	What is it?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.	And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.	Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Giulia...	Here I am.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.	And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.	I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?	Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
What other boat?	Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.	I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?	At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?	I don't see why I should mind.
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.	Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?	I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...	If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Yes.	Who?
Because...	... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.	Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Why?	They were stained.
Should you see a doctor?	I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Uh huh.	I love you.
Often?	At least once a week.
I don't know.	Do you remember the night they said it came?
Down... there.	And what did you do?
I fell asleep.	In the middle of all the pain?
What baby?	The baby they made up.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.	Agnes...
Would you like some?	I can't have them any more.
No questions.	Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
You liked Sister Paul?	She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?	She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
How did she know that?	Somebody told her.
Agnes...	You'll laugh.
Did your mother see angels often?	No.
Do you believe she really saw them?	No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?	Because I don't want one.
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?	A mistake...
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.	I'm not sick.
You can tell me.	I can't.
She's dead isn't she?	Yes.
What?	She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?	No I'm not.
Of telling you.	But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Why?	May I open my eyes now?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.	I ate.
Of what?	Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
She said Michael.	What did she mean?
So I could go to him.	Who?
No...	He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.	Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.	Why?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.	And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.	Thanks...
I don't know.	You got to be crazy.
Thanks. 	If I find anything I'll call you.
No!	Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.	Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?	No-one.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?	We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Could there have been anyone else?	Obviously there was.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.	How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.	If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.	So, someone else could have done it.
Who?	One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.	Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I was appalled, just as you are now.	And what happened?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.	But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
The Catholic Church...	I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
She is not a child.	And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.	There's another choice.
Visitors to the convent.	Nothing.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?	Yes.
Oh, Dear God...	What is it?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?	I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?	Nothing...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 	Hand rolled.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.	For the Church?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...	How  ?
But how did it happen?	You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.	That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who knew she was pregnant?	Why do you insist upon pressing...
And you didn't send her to a doctor.	I didn't guess until it was too late.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.	... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.	Shurrup!
You heard, it gets on my wick.	Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.	Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.	How about Ding Dong?
Sure.	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?	Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.	You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?	I'll have a bash.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.	I don't care.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.	Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
That's not your Grandfather.	It is, y'know.
Gerron.	No, straight up.
What's up?	He's sulking again.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...	We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.	He hasn't.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.	I'll look in here again.
Go away! You've spoilt it.	Oh, sorry I spoke.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.	D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
I see.  Do you like the play?	Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Thank you.	Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?	No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.	The big hammer?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?	What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
... all this and a jam butty too!!	I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!	And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Yes.	See you.
And what's it all come to in the end?	Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Where are you off to?	I'm going parading before it's too late!
What are they saying?	Nothing good.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.	Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Come on let's get this coffee.	Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?	You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Well, what are we waiting for?	Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Gie's a kiss!	Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
What's he know?	Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.	Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?	You're a swine, isn't he George?
No.	Ah, go on, you swine.
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.	Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.	What?
You are.	I'm not, no.
And my nose...	Well, yes your nose is. Very.
It'll only get you into trouble.	Aah, shurrup, misery!
Temper! Temper!	Well ...
Well!	He'll get over it.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?	Don't exaggerate.
Eh, where's my grandfather?	Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Well, you stick to that story, son.	I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.	Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the ... er ...	Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...	Well, give a couple of minutes ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.	You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.	But John hasn't got any.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.	Clever.  George.
How's that?	Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.	Get knotted!
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?	I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I'll set John on you!	Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Oh, a little savage, is he?	A proper Aborigine.
Locked.	Kill drive engines.
Engines off.	Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Are you in pain?	Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?	... I don't know...
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?	Receiving.
I'll go first.	No, you'll follow me.
Just machinery.	But functioning.
What is it?	Take a look.
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?	I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
What's wrong?	I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.	What?  <u>Why</u>?
What happened to the lights?	Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Where does that go?	All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Hurt!  How?	Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.	Right.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?	Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?	Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?	Right.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.	Well we better do something.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?	Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.	No, I don't want us separated.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.	Right. 
Where did it come from?	<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?	It wouldn't come.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.	Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Yes?	How's Broussard?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.	Good.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.	Sounds like a rough one.
Can you get them back?	I'm trying.
What?  What was that?	The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Oh no.	Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.	It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
What's happening up here?	I think it's fizzled out.
This is horrible.	Hey!  what about the film?
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.	I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.	Sun will be down in a minute.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.	Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
That sounds a little fanciful...	Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
They're getting pretty close now.	All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.	Look --
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.	Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.	Turn on navigation lights.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.	Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.	Good!  Moisture content?
Still worried?	Oh well... you know me.
I understand why you did that.	Good.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!	You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Now what?	I guess we open the door and net it.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!	Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.	Go ahead, Jay.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.	At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.	Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...	What can I do?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?	Sure.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.	Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?	Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Nice howitzer you've got there.	Thanks.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.	Oh man...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.	Better tell the boss.
How many of them are there?	Too many.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.	Keep trying!
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.	Shit.  When?
Where're they headed?	We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
When?	Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Picking up velocity.	Match it!
Listen to what?	That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?	I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?	Yeah, I...
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!	It's alright, it's cool...
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.	Where does that lead to?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.	What's the problem?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.	Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
That's what we thought.	Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Already working on it.	Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
They've changed their heading again.	Compensate!
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.	What?  Why?
There's still time to back-out.	Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Okay, we're in business.	Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.	I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Four.	And before that?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.	'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Yeah.  Somebody won.	Check out the tent.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.	Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
That's the wrong way!	Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Hurry it up.	Don't wait for me!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.	I... I can't!
You have to...	No!
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.	You should hit the sack, too.
'Bout five minutes.	Give me a yell is something happens.
Phoebe?	I call myself Phoebe.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-	I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I don't think that's funny.	It wasn't meant to be.
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?	Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.	I'm in love with Lloyd!
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...	... and Karen.
You sat and talked until it was light...	We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
What have you got to do with it?	Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.	What of it?
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!	She never proved anything, not a thing!
That's not true!	I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?	Yes, Addison.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.	Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Let's go sit by the piano.	You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.	Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?	That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.	As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Margo? Lunching in public?	It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...	Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Just slipped your mind.	Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...	How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
Bill...	The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Good luck, genius...	Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-	Thank you so much.
Only in some ways. You're prettier...	I'm a junk yard.
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-	Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Bill...	Huh?
You in a hurry?	A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...	Sing it?
Many happy returns of the day...	I get a party, don't I?
She did...?	She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Yeah... I will.	How is Eve? Okay?
I love you too. Good night, darling-	See you...
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...	She's a girl of so many interests.
So she seems.	So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?	It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Addison-!	So full of meaning, fire and music!
It's obvious you're not a woman.	I've been aware of that for some time.
It's not nonsense.	But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...	I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.	He does not exaggerate. I was good.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.	Glory Hallelujah.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...	I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...	You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Yes, dear.	You know what I'm going to be?
Often enough to keep the franchise.	A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Hello, what's your name?	Eve. Eve Harrington.
Every day.	You didn't have to tell me.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.	You shouldn't have had any doubts.
You think?	I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...	What did you expect - live sables?
You need new girdles.	Buy some.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-	You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
You don't like Eve, do you?	Do you want an argument or an answer?
She works hard.	Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-	Like an agent with one client.
You all put together?	My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.	That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.	Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Who are you?	Miss Harrington...
You probably won't believe me.	Probably not.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.	I might.
That's the door.	You rest. I'll get it...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.	He's the best.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?	Eve. Eve Harrington.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.	I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?	No, Eve, I won't forget...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-	Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.	I don't intend to be.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-	Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.	Let's not get over-dramatic.
He can help you.	I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
She knows enough not to be here.	But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.	I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
No, don't go...	The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...	Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.	Really, Eve? Why?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...	Why not?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...	I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...	I'm so happy you're happy.
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...	Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
How far to the station?	Three or four miles...
Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
He's in love with you.	More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Why should he - and why should you?	Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Not to you. Not to Bill.	Isn't that what they always say?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?	Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
With tears?	With tears.
How was the concert?	Loud.
Lloyd, what happened...?	Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
That's on time for Margo.	Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Lloyd, be careful...	Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?	I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-	Where'd you get all that information?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...	That was a pity...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...	I'm trying hard to follow you.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...	With gestures, of course.
- well? What happened?	Nothing much. She apologized.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?	Not much.
What's so funny?	Nothing...
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-	I'm a human being, I've got some!
Who's left out there?	Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
How's the new one coming?	The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?	Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?	How do you mean?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...	Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
She's your understudy.	Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I'm sure.	She was a revelation...
Hello..	We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
That's right, but I don't understand-	We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
"Liebestraum."	I just played it.
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?	How about me what?
When's the audition?	A couple of weeks.
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?	Would you?
Anything to help you out, Max.	This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-	All you got to do is name it.
You get quick action, don't you?	Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-	Well...
--it was fine the way it was--	--it was bullshit the way it was--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--	--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--	--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Carl?	Yeah?
All right, what do we know?	Let me lay a little theory on you--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--	--a spy, you mean?
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.	We need a sympathetic face.
Goddamnit--	--see?--
And?--And?--	--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Who's first?	Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
I don't get it... this really was my turf...	You're not a kid anymore.
Anything you've got.	We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?	I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.	It's safe, try it, you'll see.
I hate both parties.	And I'm a Republican.
Republican?	Sure.
'68.	Nixon.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.	Go on, go on--
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--	--we will--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--	--shit, who do we know?--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--	--I haven't said anything--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--	--Haldeman I know, who else?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?	Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
I think that's him.	Who?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.	It's nothing personal, though. 
How many fucking sources they think we got?--	--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
You overslept?	Goddamnit!--
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?	Whatever.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?	This?  Naw...
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.	Any idea what he did?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?	They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.	I know where Dwight works.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.	Chapin did contact you then?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.	It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Can't help you.	At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--	--that was awhile ago--
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?	Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--	--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?	'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
Something maybe big.	And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
But they both worked at the White House?	I will not talk about the other two.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?	Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
Then it's our asses, isn't it?	And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
Same kind of crap--	--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--	--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--	--you double-checked both sources?--
I got Clawsen on hold--	--his dialing finger must be falling off--
We can't talk inside either?	Electronic surveillance.
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--	--I'm not here.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?	I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.	If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?	John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.	To where?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.	I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.	Who?--be specific. How high up?
What?	Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
And Justice and FBI know all this?	Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Where?	The C.I.A.
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--	--I'm Woodward.
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?	I think so.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--	--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."	You can't believe that.
What'd you get on W.House?	Lotsa hints--
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.	Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?	Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?	I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
--which Young?	Larry Young, a California lawyer--
Mr. Sloan?	My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?	No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 	One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
I'll do it.	Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!	Sorry, coach.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?	Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.	As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?	Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
This is your plan, Finch?	Yep.
This.  Right now.	Uh-huh.
Not bad, Chris.	Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Hey, what're you doing here?	Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Stifler told me.	You talked to Stifler?
Onions?	What?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...	...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
I think I've had one.	Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Jessica, can you drive me home?	Sure.
You think she was serious?	I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
That's stupid.	No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.	Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?	Yeah.
Can I come in?	Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?	Dad, come in.
Dad.	Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
What was your name again?	Michelle.
Whatever you want.	Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!	I told you.
This'll do.	Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!	Okay!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.	A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
You guys got the Latin homework?	No -- Kevin, you?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.	"Fun loving" -- insane.
You can do that?	Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
I still think you're okay.	So do I, Kev.
You did it.	Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Yes.  No.  Yes.	Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Uh...	Move with the music.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.	Nadia, I can't --
Jim...	Oh no.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.	Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Stifler, you're such an asshole.	Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.	You think so?
Oh, Kev.	Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Tonight?	Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Vicky, wait.	Not for you.
And I want to try to make it up to you.	How?
Oh...ungghhhhh!	Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
I think you're so right, Kevin.	You want to do it?
Hey...	Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?	Yeah, right here.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?	I don't know.  How do you?
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.	I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.	What?!  How do I do that?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.	This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!	Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.	Dude, prom sucks.
So does your tongue cramp up?	Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?	I think we're falling in love.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.	Dude, he does not.
I think you need your balls reattached.	Keep it down, dude.
What the fuck are you doing here?	This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Our last game is this Saturday.	No shit.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.	No way.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -	Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.	Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?	Yeah. Apparently.
Salots! Shitfucker!	What?
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.	Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Fan-fucking-tastic?	Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!	Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Don't you want to change?	Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...	So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
This looks familiar...	Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?	Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.	A cure?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...	I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
What makes you so sure this will work?	I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I don't know...	Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.	I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Holy mother of God...	Fuck me...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.	That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!	"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Pull over! Now!	Shit!
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?	Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Claude...?	And you call me a moron...
The ADM. Let's go.	Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?	If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Ha. Some wonder drug...	Why isn't it doing anything!?
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.	Oh no... no....
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.	What about me?
What?	He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.	Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?	It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Because Gaston was after it.	Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...	That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!	You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.	Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?	I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!	No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -	Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...	God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Merde.	He says -
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.	Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
Saint Severin...	You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.	I know, but I had to because . . .
Where is your home, Anya?	I'm not sure but look. . .
I have to go now, before it gets light.	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Is everyone all right?	I'm fine.
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.	Who's Sophie?
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 	What happened to your parents?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
By pulling my hair?!	I was all out of dynamite!
Just what do you think you're doing?!	Trying... to... breathe...
Come on!	No!
You must enjoy causing me pain!	You shouldn't have pushed us!
I'm so scared...	Don't be
Anya, wait!	Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Don't you, child?	Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
What?	Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Hurry up with those papers.	Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.	"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
What do we do now?	Pray he's color-blind...
So where will you go?	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...	STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...	What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.	Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?	Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.	Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
We've been through this.	If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Yeah, Earl Warren?	Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.	How can you possibly oversleep?
Alvy, I...	What-what-what-what's the matter?
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.	M'm.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.	Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.	Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.	Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?	Yeah, I know.
Well... thank you again.	Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you see an analyst?	Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Sylvia Plath.	M'hm...
Neat?	Neat, yeah.
Uh, narcolepsy.	Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
God bless.	Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?	You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-	Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.	You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Yeah.	you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Okay?	Yeah.
No.	No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-	Yeah?
Those are the two categories...	M'hm.
You see, like you and I...	You are extremely sexy.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.	Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
You- Do you love me?	Do I love you?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...	Yeah.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?	Mine.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.	That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Yes, it is.	It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.	Well, have you ever made love high?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?	Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Yeah.	Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
You're so sure about it.	Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.	We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
I'm home!	Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Yeah, and he's strangling me...	Yeah?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.	Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.	Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?	A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
What's- It's me, open up.	Oh.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?	No.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?	Yeah.
Very big spider.	Yeah?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?	It's for my complexion.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?	Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Okay, okay. Okay.	That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Happy birthday.	What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-	Thing?
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?	I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 	All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.	I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.	No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.	Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.	Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.	Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
You look very pretty.	Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.	Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?	No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.	Why are you so hostile?
Oh, I'm sorry!	Don't get upset!
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-	Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
What-	My head is throbbing.
Where are you going?	Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.	I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.	Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...	What are you depressed about?
Yes.	Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Charlie Chaplin.	Hey.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-	May I see your license, please?
Just give me the license, please.	Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Ah.	Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Oh.	Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?	Max, I've got a hit series.
How about a ginger ale?	Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.	Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
There are no twos, Max.	Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.	Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
You fired the cleaning woman?	She was stealing.
All right-so we can afford it.	How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.	Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.	Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Oh.	Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.	Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.	Hey-
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.	I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?	I was very charming.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?	A long time.
She's a constant surprise.	And you've only just met.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.	The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?	Leo?
You don't have any clothes on.	How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
What what's about?	I...wait, what are you talking about?
Honey?	I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.	Of course.
I'm glad that's all over for me.	Don't you miss it?
What is that thing?	So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Let's get the kids.	Oh my God, the sitter.
He's gonna miss his flight.	Yeah.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.	Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Directing suits you.	I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.	Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
So?	I love you, Joe Therrian.
You need to call your dad.	Leave us alone right now.
And you know our friends, how?	We live next door.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?	You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.	Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
We closed.	Fantastic.  Out here.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.	We couldn't be on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.	Did you invite them?
You're out of your mind.	Just do what I say, alright?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?	Beats a lawsuit.
Take your time, Jer.	I'm ready.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?	Ryan's novel.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.	Hardly...
What?	They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.	You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
You want me to uninvite her?	No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.	Really?
In the kitchen.	Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Two minutes.	It's alright.  Be our guests.
It's an unfair advantage.	You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.	I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.	Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Otis!!!!	Otis!!!!
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.	Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.	Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?	Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Cal, too?	Sally, for Christ's sake.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.	You changed your mind.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.	You're not ready.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?	I guess.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?	Nothing that can't be exchanged.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.	Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes, she is.	But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
No.	It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Don't I find what?	I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Joking.	Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?	Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.	Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
A little out of my element.	No you're not.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.	Hm.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.	What?
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...	Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.	And you know, he really does not.
Easy tiger.	Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
What am I, five?	You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon or raspberry?	Lemon.
Yes.	And he doesn't smoke?
Ryan.	I'm sure you understand.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.	I'm not going to leave you alone.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.	Why?
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.
I'm sorry.	There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.	You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Come on in.	I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
The charades.	Thank you.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.	Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Fuck you, Panes.	You see, that's worse.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.	Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.	Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.	"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Like the last time.	No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
It's our anniversary, Panes.	I didn't hear me say tonight.
Everyday.	I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
So tell me, how's it going?	Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
You're my best friend.	That's not an answer, is it?
We're going to have to go back out there.	I guess.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.	At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
You're keeping a record, are you?	It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.	Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Monica and Ryan.	Rose.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.	Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?	And here they are!
What do you mean, thank God?	Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?	You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.	Neither does Joe.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.	Why are you doing this?
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...	Invisible!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
You dance...	Divinely?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --	Quiet -- sshhh!!
What <u>was</u> that thing?	How should <u>I know</u>?
I order you to find out where we are!	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!	Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.	<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
We're going to die!	Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
And only you can become a Queen?	Well...no, but --
Why do they have you tied up here?	There's something going on, Z --
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.	You did?
You new, kid?	I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!	Superior numbers, kid!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.	Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.	No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.	Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?	That's correct, sir!
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.	Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Affirmative.	So...you two are in love?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.	Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...Not enough food?	Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?	I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
ARREST HIM!	Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?	We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.	Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.	And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!	Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?	What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?	My mother.
This the place?	Yeah.  How much?
So this is your mother's apartment?	That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.	Something the matter?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.	Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?	Well, I have some paper towels --
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.	Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?	Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Sure.	I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Eight-thirty.	Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.	How is your cold?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.	Oh.
One more?	I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?	Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?	Of course not.
Here.	After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Your phone.	Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?	Two o'clock.
Something wrong with your legs?	No -- it's my stomach.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.	That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?	I'm not very good at it.
I don't want it.	Pick a card.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.	Gin.
Cut.	So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Why not?	Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.	Who'd care?
Are you all right?	Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?	As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?	No, I don't.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?	Where?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!	That's terrible.
We're going to finish that gin game.	Oh.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?	You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.	Good night, Miss Kubelik.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?	I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.	Shut up and deal!
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?	No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.	What for?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.	Gas?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.	Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
The Vice Squad?	That's right, Baxter.
Where is your apartment?	West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.	So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
You know how people talk.	Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, yes. Thanks.	The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
So it was.  She threw it at me.	Sir?
You're going to take her off my hands?	That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Yeah --	Now what was your news, Baxter?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.	That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
On account of me.	You?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.	I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Mr. Sheldrake?	That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.	Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --	Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?	I have a vague idea.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --	I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Want to tell me what happened?	I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Help yourself.	I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I'm not sure.	A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Yeah, wasn't I?	But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?	Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
That so.	All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Family?	No.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?	Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
You got a girl-friend?	She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.	Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Yes, I know.	So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I don't know what you're talking about.	And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?	It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.	Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
I don't believe you.	Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?	Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.	Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Remember what we talked about?	We talked about a lot of things.
You didn't really believe me, did you?	They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.	Are you sure that's what you want?
I have that date -- remember?	I love you -- remember?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.	I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.	Atlantic City?
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.	The nerve.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?	I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What are you talking about?	I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!	First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Did you have a nice Christmas?	Lovely. You were a big help.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --	Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.	Dreadful.
We need all our fuel anyway.	Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --	Esprit de corps --
No -- absolutely not --	One for all -- all for one --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.	Get out --
Two whole drums --	We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Winning the war by yourself.	Part.
That's good gin.	I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
That's quite an array of ribbons...	Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.	Tracks ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.	Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?	No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
How?	They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
And the grass?	Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.	I know.
Can I go get those mangos now?	I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Smoke !	Where ?
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --	I'll go with him --
Get in there !	This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
I --	I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Listen.	What is it?
What cat  ?	One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I never heard about that.	Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.	I wonder if that was the same copter.
You didn't like him.	Anyone got a cigarette.
Touchy.	You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Yeah.	He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.	Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Captain?	You'll get blown outta here some day.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?	We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
What's your name, sailor ?	Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?	I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?	Boss left.
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.	It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.	Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
What'd you do for supplies?	Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?	I met him.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.	So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.	You'll find enough Cong up there.
You were not coming here, to see me?	No -- no, sir.
Do you know me?	Yes.
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.	You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You've gone crazy.	No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.	Fuck no.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.	You had immense plans... immense plans...
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.	You knew him best.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...	Both of us...
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --	What is this bridge?
Simple. They don't want him to go.	You're Australian?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --	And shut up.
Are you warm, Captain?	The river is beautiful.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --	Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
What show ?	Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?	Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
20   CONTINUED:  	You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
30   CONTINUED:	Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.	89   CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:	Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
...I won't let a killer walk!	157  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:	I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.	26   CONTINUED:  
How long have you been up north?	Six months.
My dad was a Navy doctor.	Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had?	She's dead.
What happened here?	The radio's on the fritz.
Was there any trouble?	He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
What's going on?	I'll tell you everything later.
Surviving is what I know --	-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.	I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.	Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Be my guest.	I'm right behind you.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?	It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?	You know Meyerling?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.	I'm here to do my job.
Have to get these wet things off.	You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Don't push me..!	Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.	Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.	I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!	Nothing personal.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.	Sure.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.	Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?	Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?	There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Alleged killer.	What does this matter to you?
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.	Fuck you.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?	I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.	Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?	Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.	Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.	What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Thought that door was open last night...	Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?	Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
...Ben never sent a signal.	Musta never got a chance to -more-
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.	That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?	We were just talking about him.
It's Sam Wilder!	Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.	Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.	Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.	I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
How was it talking to him?	Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?	He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Have they done blood tests on him?	Yes.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.	Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?	No.
It's amazing these things weren't done.	Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.	Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?	Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.	You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?	I see the help -- judgement call.
Sorry.	It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Uh, Udall?	Carol the waitress?
I'm not kidding.	Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
What's this?	A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Okay.	Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Lovely.	I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Nice of you... thank you.	Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?	I want you to go on this trip.
Melvin, I'd rather not.	What's that got to do with it?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.	Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.	Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?	Whether crabs are in season there now...
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.	You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.	Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.	That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.	Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
I'll never forget you said it.	It was a mistake.
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Hello.	Yeah... Well...
That seems like a good choice.	I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Because...	It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.	Okay.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.	You know what? I...
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?	Yes. I really would.
Well...	No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?	No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Uh-huh...	I'm sorry... are you okay?
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.	Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.	I just love her.  How're you doing?
I love you...  Let him take you home.	Don't want to. I love you.
What the heck are those for?	No. No. Get Carol.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.	There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...	Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...	Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...	Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
No touch. No touch. No touch.	You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
How's Verdell doing?	He's a pain in the ass.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.	Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Actually, I don't think so.	Wait here.
How you doing, great one?	I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.	Well, I can't reach them.
Oh, is he dead?	Ask him.
Which color was that?	Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.	How're you doing?
Yeeeess!!!	Maybe this can wait.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...	Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
I carry bacon in my pocket.	Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.	Come on, sweetheart...
I brought you Chinese soup.	Thanks.
Not it at all, really.	Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.	I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.	Another place where?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.	Just a second -- he has to go.
Why are you doing this?	No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.	Where?
What?	What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's	So you're from around here?
Where you from?	What is this?
What are you doing?	Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
You can't --	The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --	Tachlinkov.
So what happens now?	We go around once.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?	Oh, yeah.
Game over, bitch!	Bain!
I'm on the scent.	You're too late.
Such language in front of a lady.	I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.	I'm part of the game, just like you.
Now what?	Turn off the engine.
Okay.  How did you find me?	You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Nikita?	Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
He wants to kill you?	Yes.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!	If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Why?	Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Had?	He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.	Why not?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.	Ahhhh...
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.	Are they usually like that?
No.  Just the first one.	After that?
Did it ever bother James Bond?	That's fiction.
No.	Why not?
Do you think about the game?	Yes.
Not even a stalemate?	No.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?	I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
What do you think he's doing?	I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.	That means you won't have a gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.	You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.	Sounds pretty well figured out.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.	Except --
What did he say?	He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
You didn't take it.	No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Did you think they were newlyweds?	I didn't notice them.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.	How do you know they're not?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.	Jesus, if someone had --
No?	It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
I know.  It makes me crazy.	Why?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.	And you were drilling these holes...?
Because, I'll take it.	I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Attraction is a complication?	It can be.
Is this becoming complicated?	I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Was nice.	Yes.
I prefer it like this.	How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Would you like a drink?	I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
You're very good at this aren't you?	I think you're supposed to answer that question.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?	Sometimes.
Do you think about their wives or their families?	No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Do you ever think about starting over?	All the time.
Then, I'll sail alone.	Do you believe that?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.	Sure.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?	Average.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.	Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.	Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Some.	When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Can I ask you a question?	Anything.
Why didn't you fade?	You mean quit?
Yeah.	I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?	No.
You wish to close this account today?	That's correct.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?	I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Of course, senor.	Thank you.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.	Like you?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.	And not even then sometimes.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.	What's that? Free!
Who's your friend?	That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.	No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.	Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".	He was an electrician?
Well, don't get carried away.	I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?	No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?	None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Moved on to plumbing huh?	We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
Like helping a sick kid?	No, for the Asylum.
Afternoon!	Am I late?
And a tram hit you?	No, the boyfriend.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?	Holly!
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?	It just happened.
A fine specimen for conversion.	What are you on about?
Chris, can you do me a favour?	What?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.	You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
I don't want to ruin your day.	That bad?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.	What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
What about me?	Here!
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?	I'm not hungry, really.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....	No, by road?
It's that one isn't it.	Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Good morning.	I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?	They didn't look like medical files to me.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.	Regards to Her Majesty.
I could pencil you in if you like?	I'll take a rain-check for now.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.	Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?	I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.	What? You are crazy!
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!	Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?	Fernet and tonic.
If you get out can we be together again.	I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
But we could go to London and live in England.	No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.	Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.	So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.	Don't worry. Thanks.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!	How?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.	A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
You mean it's started?	Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.	Well she sure isn't normal.
I thought I'd help out.	We don't need you.
Why are you doing all this, what for?	Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
A champion of lost causes huh?	No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Shall I wash these out?	Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Is it dry?	Yeah seems okay.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?	Sure!
Better than you.	Hmm, I still owe him.
Where did you steal the car?	It's Josh's.
Why did you break into that particular building?	It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?	A kind of freedom.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.	Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.	Not all of them!
What is it you want?	First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
I'll need to make a phone call.	You may use my office.
I don't want to go.	It's time to go home, Holly.
That's my bag.	Go to hell!
It's more than what you're worth.	You bastard!
What are you an idiot!	The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.	Very well.
She's coming over here...	Heart be still.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.	Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.	I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.	I didn't know either.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.	I need to whizz.
She's like some Puritan.	She's not. She's got her own ideas.
I don't make small talk --	-- Obviously.
Because, growing up, books were my world.	Were?
You don't know me.	Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'I hope your dreams come true.'	'They won't.'
What's with the friggin numbers?	28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Looking for intelligent life?	Looking for something -- someone.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.	Don't you?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.	Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.	Interpreted by another guy like my father.
He doesn't trust you.	Sometimes I don't even trust me.
The play's in a couple of weeks.	Yes. And?
Oh. Just not at school...	Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.	Belinda's a very jealous person.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --	You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Like fire.	What?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.	I wanted this to be a date.
Stand right here.	Where?
You make me feel...	Loved?
What'd you tell your father?	The truth. I just left you out of it.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?	Me.
What are you going to -- ?	Pull over.
Nope.	Anything you want.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.	I used to like yogurt.
What are you thinking?	That I want you to take me home.
I'll talk to your father.	It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Did you give him a gift?	No.
I'm asking how much.	Dad --
I care for her.	I don't want to see her hurt.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.	How -- how long does she have?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.	Praying.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --	If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Landon. You go on home.	I'm not tired.
You have materials for the side bearings?	I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
You know about this stuff?	I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.	She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Now I can do what I want.	That's right.  The world is your oyster.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.	The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --	What do you want, Biff?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?	I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?	Uh, yes, sir...
What's N.R.C.?	I don't know. National Cash Register?
Hi, Marty.	Uh, hi....
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.	Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Hi, Marty!	Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.	Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
No, Chinese food is fine.	Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!	Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Why what?	Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?	Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.	Operator, what's today's date?
What, am I radioactive or something?	No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!	Shhhhhhhh!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!	That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?	Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!	Is Shemp all right?
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.	Marty.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.	We don't....
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?	What if you lost your keys?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?	Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
An atomic bomb.	Professor, be serious, would you?
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!	You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.	Jesus!
You didn't?	Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.	I run this place! 
Gone?... Where?	He said not to tell.
Oh yeah?	Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?	Yeah.
Catch!	What do you mean?
What'd they look like?	Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.	Mmmmm.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.	Sure.
Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.	Is that right?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?	You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?	It's okay.
Nothing.	There you go.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?	Yeah.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.	You said that once already... Too late now.
Why?	They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?	Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Look at all this junk.	How's he doing?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.	Excuse me.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?	Well, why you always walking behind me?
Yes.	Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I'd like to get out of here.	Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Have you got a better idea?	I just don't want to go.
This your place?	Yes.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?	Stay as long as you like.
Hi, whatcha doing?	Just thinking.
Yes.	Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.	Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!	Who're you?
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!	You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.	Then that's it!
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?	It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Then what?	Vanished. Thin air.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...	And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
We will, old fried, we will.	Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?	Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.	Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
What is this thing?  A fighter?	Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!	The door's locked.
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.	John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Raise your hand...where?	This is so embarrassing...
Did you say..."Peggy"?	My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
He offered you money?	Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Go away.  Let me rot?	Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?	Which?  The one in my throat.
How did she die?  I wanna know.	You don't wanna know.
Never.	I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.	Believe in Penny Priddy?
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.	A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
What's happening with my call to SAC?	Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
What's his problem?	Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
It's a spittin' image.	Doesn't look anything like her to me.
So where's Buckaroo?	Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?	Flying to Cambodia.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.	How about you? Will you be alright?
I see.	...I know this must look... funny.
Let him go.	That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.	Really?...
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –	Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.	Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-	You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-	Hah!
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-	Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Ever talk to him?	...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.	So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?	And what would that be, son?
...Huh? No, I'm –	We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.	But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!	Well not much.
A souse!	You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
I don't understand-	Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I can't write anything by tomorrow.	Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.	Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?	No, what did it say?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?	Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
...That's fine.	Have you read the Bible, Garland?
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?	Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.	Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?	No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.	Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.	Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
...I don't guess this means much to you.	Hell, I could tell you some stories–
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.	I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –	You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
...This must be boring you.	Not at all. It's damned interesting.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?	...Yeah, okay.
It's okay, it's okay.	Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
I hope these are your shoes.	Hi, Charlie.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.	Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?	Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.	Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Why don't we go to your room-	Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Hold on –	You gotta believe me –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.	I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Jesus... They can tell that...	They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Yeah, but Charlie –	Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
...Where did we put him?	I'm at the Earle.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?	...Both maybe?
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –	Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!	You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.	His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.	He's a little funny in the head.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.	Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.	All of which he's now missin'.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.	Anyway.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.	Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?	Give you nose bleeds?
He teach you to do it?	You two have some sick sex thing?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.	Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!	Mr. Lipnik, please –
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.	Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Where were you tonight?	Home. Watching TV.
All night?	Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.	When did you start drinking again?
There's no smoking in this building.	What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
How is your -- personal life?	My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
You okay?	Yeah.
Catherine Tramell.	She said what you said she'd say.
We were in some of the same classes.	Why didn't you tell me?
Who?	Nilsen.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.	What was she like in school?
What do you want, Nick?	Tell me about Catherine.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.	She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.	I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
How long were you having sex with him?	About a year and a half.
Did you leave the club with him?	Yes.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.	Are you arresting me?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?	Only when they make interesting reading.
I told you -- I quit.	It won't last.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.	Yes it does, doesn't it?
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.	I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
But you didn't hurt --	No.
Even though you were fucking him.	You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.	Why not?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.	You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.	Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.	There's a name from the past.
I didn't.	Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
How exactly did you hear?	I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.	Don't get too cocky.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?	What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.	I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Why take the risk?	To see if I can get away with it.
Did you think it was so special?	I told her it was the fuck of the century.
You shouldn't play this game.	I don't have a choice.
Do you think I told her to kill You?	No.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?	For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.	I never have before.
You won't believe me.	Try me.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?	I found Lisa Henderson.
I have to do some research tomorrow.	I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
No thanks.	What are you researching?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.	What happens to them?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.	It won't sell.
What do we do now, Nick?	We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.	What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?	Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?	I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
How did he die?	He was murdered.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.	Was his wife ever a suspect?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.	Do you remember his name?
What kind of talk?	The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?	Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.	I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
How'd it go, son?	She misses me.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?	What are you doing here, Pop?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?	Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
You think I --	I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!	You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?	In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?	Catherine told me what was in it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.	Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
You look like dogshit.	He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.	Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.	You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
So what do we do -- nothing?	We bring her in for questioning.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.	She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Now what?	What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.	Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?	Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.	It was an accident.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --	I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
She's a suspect.	On what basis?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.	She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --	Are you vice?
Who are you?	I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?	No. Should I have?
When's your show?	Not sure. How was yours?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..	Do you ever get sick of it?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.	I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
It's in New York.	Oh, I didn't know that.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.	My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.	Yeah, I met her already.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.	Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?	I don't like beer.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.	How do you know?
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.	Sure, ok..
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?	I need a dealer.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?	Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."	Who said that?
Would you like to see the wine list?	Chateau Latour '64, please.
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.	See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.	Really?
You want me to put it here?	Use your fucking instinct.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?	Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.	Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
You got a date already?	We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?	So then what?
She's good.	I guess it was a long time ago.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?	C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You're back.	It's Monday morning.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?	I hadn't thought about it.
... babies.	You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?	You're your own baby.
Hi.	Hi.
What's that?	A present I picked up for you.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.	He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –	What's that about?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –	I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
I really... admire you.	Me? Why?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.	You like your dad's paintings?
See you later.	Thanks
No, I'd like the scarf.	Have a Mac.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?	Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..	Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
That one's for you.	Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
You don't have any!!!	That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.	I just don't think you're being fair.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.	Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...	"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?	You'll never guess.
Admiring your handiwork?	Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Well that's a ... long story ...	Well, I could ... free up some time...
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.	Treat to be here.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?	I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?	Yes and no...
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?	Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?	If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...	Y'mean take off our costumes?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...	But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
... What do we do?	I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
No.  No glass on the inside.	Weird, huh?
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.	Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--	Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?	He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?	Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.	You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.	The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
You buy this "blurry" business?	Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.	And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.	A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
I don't.  So, no.	I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.	And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?	Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
You certainly will not.	Oh no, those things frighten me.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.	I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.	As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.	I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.	Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
You have?	Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.	There's a lovely inn just down --
I am as well as can be expected.	Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
I love you, old man.	Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
It's good to see you.	What seems to be the problem?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.	Keep it.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.	Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?	Alfred's happy here.
Nice suit.  And today you are?	Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...	I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Umm-hmmmm.	Definitely.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.	A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
We gotta get those locks changed.	She knows who we are.
Winded, old timer?	Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?	Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.	I see you knew him.
And?	Can I get some help over here?
You're not even listening to me.	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.	I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Who's Ivy?	What?
What happened to his wife?	Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.	Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.	Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Like hell you do.	Dick, don't push me right now.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.	She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.	I knew you could handle it.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?	Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.	Adam and Evil.
What say we turn up the heat?	You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
How about dangerous curves?	Of trust. Tell me your plan.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.	Then you never loved me?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?	Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.	What did you say?
Letters in the alphabet.	Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
What now sir?	Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Up here, Al.	Just checking, young sir.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.	I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...	Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.	It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?	No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.	Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Mr...?	Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?	Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.	Wait. You can't go.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?	Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?	So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
That kid is amazing.	I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.	The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Why do you do that?	What?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.	Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...	Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.	I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
You can't-.	Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.	And when you finally get Two-Face?
Who is The Batman, Edward?	Can't tell if you don't say please.
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.	...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
...or death.	Please. I swear I won't say noth-
How'd you find us?	You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?	Let's see if you bleed green.
Holy shit.	So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?	Here. Get a good seat.
How high up would you say that is?	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.	Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.	Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
GET IN THE CAR!!	WHICH CAR?
Look! Police!	I know. I called them.
What about the girl?	He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
How much do you weigh?	... A hundred and eight?
Thank you, Vicki.	... Where are you taking me?
How'd you find this place?	Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?	I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.	What is it you want?
No.	Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.	Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.	Maybe we should just kiss.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?	I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?	No one would miss me.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.	What are you talking about?
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -	Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
My brother's a priest, man.	No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?	Because I want someone I can trust.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.	A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.	Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
No.	Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?	Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.	... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.	... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!	Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin	Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And what did you say?	I said I'd check with you.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...	What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.	Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Here, let me do that.	No, I'm fine.
Goodnight Annie.	Night.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.	Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.	Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?	Ahm.....
Oh yes.	Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.	Well, Ahm....
It's very good Bernie.	But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
And howls Alison?	She's ... well, she's good.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.	Yes, isn't he.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.	Great news.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.	Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...	I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.	Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?	Certainly is.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.	Richard Burton was very good-looking.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?	Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.	That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...	I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.	Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
off the peg?	Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".	It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Come on Sting!	Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.	No it wasn't!
We're gonna get paid to score.	Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.	Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?	Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.	Heh heh. Yeah.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?	Me first!
No way butt-hole! I want the window.	Cut it out butt-hole!
This is dumb, let's find that chick.	Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!	Cool! Huh huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.	Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Whoa, my life is cool!	Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!	Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.	Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.	Butt-dumpling...
Um... ass... head...	Uh... butt-snatch...
You already said that, Butt-Head.	Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Beavis.	That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.	Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!	Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!	He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.	Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Did you give him a full cavity search?	Ah, the witness?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.	Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.	Where are his pants?
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.	Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?	Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
You scored with two chicks?!	Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?	I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.	<u>You</u> left me.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?	Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.	We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
My God, we're back where we started.	Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.	She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?	Of course I did.
But <u>we</u> let him out.	I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...	Let's see if she can get my model back.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?	I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.	Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?	Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.	We have to start simpler, is that it?
Just get some people out of our house.	Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Just one daughter.	Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.	Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.	About what?
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.	No, Lydia, we're dead.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.	And live in what, our station wagon?
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.	'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...	They're dead.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'	Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.	I... I don't know what your name is.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.	It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.	How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!	How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
It's <u>Otho</u>!	Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.	Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.	My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.	Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...	Stepmother.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --	Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!	Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.	I cannot believe this.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.	I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
They're... not here anymore.	Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Are they suffering?	They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.	This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Don't you <u>dare</u>.	I saw some ghosts.
What do you think?	Viridian?
<u>Oh my God</u>!	<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?	Attic space.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.	Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Is this the key to the attic?	That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?	Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.	Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Otho, that's terrible.	My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!	I'll need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.	Their wedding clothes.
You can pull your trousers up, now.	Oh, fine.
An attorney?	Yes.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...	Thank you.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.	Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... And please call me Robert.	Yes, Robert. I will.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?	Hardly any, Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.	Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.	How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.	... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Yes. I love Eve very much.	I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!	To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.	We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.	I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.	Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.	He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
... Do you think we should look for him?	I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.	Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.	Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.	And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.	Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
A Black man gave me the message.	Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.	Thank you.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.	Yes. I would like to be on that show.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.	There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...	I agree.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?	I like to watch. This is fine.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.	Yes.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?	No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?	He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?	... Mentor...?
Chauncey...	Hello, Eve.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.	That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.	I see.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.	Yes. That could be true.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...	Thank you.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.	No. I'm not busy.
... Are you sure you like it?	Yes, I do, it's very good.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.	Ben is very ill.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!	We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.	Do you think so? Do you think so?
I feel very good in here.	Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.	What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?	Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.	I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Bravo!	But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
Well, that's good news, my boy.	You're looking much better today, Ben.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.	I understand.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.	Yes. That is correct.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.	I understand.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...	A flower...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?	Yes.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?	Yes, I would like to see Ben.
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?	No.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?	No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.	It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...	No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.	I agree.
How long do we stay in here?	How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Evening, Chance.	... Good evening, Louise.
... I see.	Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?	I am a very serious gardener.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.	... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.	Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?	Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?	I live here.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?	No, I do not have any of those.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.	Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.	You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Correct.	Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!	Try again.
You heard?	I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
... Ben, really...	... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.	Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.	Would you two excuse me for a moment?
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?	Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
... Would you take me on a tour?	Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... Yeah...	... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
No! He's a real gardener!	He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...	Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.	There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'	Very good, Your Excellency.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.	Gardiner, yes, sir.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.	No problem, Chief.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.	Right, Chief.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.	Right, Chief.
... So what does all that add up to?	Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.	Thank you, Colonel.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.	Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
... Well?	Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...	I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.	Please, have a seat.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.	Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.	Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Seven-ish	We have to make it an early night.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.	Hmmm.
So how was it? What was he doing?	Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.	You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.	What?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.	Life is confusing, isn't it?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.	I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?	Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.	That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
My God!	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.	You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Holy shit! He said what I said!	Holy shit! He said what I said!
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...	This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?	No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Pardon?	Schwartz.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.	I am a trained performer.
No. I understand perfectly.	Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?	Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am	Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.	You're insane.
Moving story.	Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.	How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Why not?	Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Who told you?	I'm right?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.	My tits?
That's the usual?	Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Hi.	You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.	You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.	Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!	I'll protect you, Dollface.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!	So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
You're late.	Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.	I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Lotte, this is so good...	Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Lotte? Is that you?	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!	Ha ha ha!
No. Don't be an ass.	Can I be anyone I want?
Vegas? What'd you think?	The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
What kind of circumstances?	Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Do tell. I love a good plan.	Why are you being like this?
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.	Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.	Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.	Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Do you dream often?	Do you?
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?	All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?	Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
But now we've lost access to Craig.	My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.	Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.	No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.	Why not? I need to get in there!
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.	I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.	I love you, Lotte.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!	Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.	I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.	Did you see the reviews?
You still there, sweets?	Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.	Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Bad dream, darling?	I've got to leave Malkovich.
Yeah what?!	Derek Mantini!
Captain Mertin?	What want ye, girl child?
You still know.	What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...	The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.	WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.	YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..	Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...	Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
I want somethin' sweet.	We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Well, good luck with the job.	Thank you.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?	I will.
Yes?	May I come in?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.	Oh.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.	Ya think?
I want to work, Miss Lady.	Work? Start learnin your letters again?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.	DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Morning.	Morning, ma'am.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.	Oh I been out.
True.	Better ask Paul D.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?	I don't know him that well.
What run him off? Tell me that!	I run him off.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.	He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.	That's so.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.	Just me.
You remember your price, Stamp?	Never found out.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..	I don't believe that. I won't.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.	What yard? When who-
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...	You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
You shaved.	Yeah. Look bad?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...	She was my best thing.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.	Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.	Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.	And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.	Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.	Why me, man?
That had not occurred to us, Dude.	Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Hey, man, I'm not--	Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Jesus fucking Christ.	Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.	Fuck you.
Excuse me?	Nothing.
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?	Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Sheesh.	Walter, how--
Where you going, Dude?	I'm going home, Donny.
Almost five!	I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?	I'm shomer shabbas.
Kill that poor woman.	Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.	They were Nazis, Dude?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."	Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Jesus, man, can you change the station?	Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Please, feel free to inspect them.	I'm not really, uh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--	Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.	Far out.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--	I see.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?	Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.	...Also, my rug was stolen.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?	I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--	I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!	Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.	Jeffrey Lebowski.
"Johnson"?	Thank you.
Huh?	Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
You mean coitus?	I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.	He fixes the cable?
Shit yeah, the achievers.	Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?	I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
And please don't call her my mother.	Now I got--
Well...yeah--	Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--	Do you still have that doctor's number?
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.	Oh?
Increases?	Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.	You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Anyway.  How much they offer you?	Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--	What if it's during a game?
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.	Huh?
The fucking point is--	It's your roll.
The what?	The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?	Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!	Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
...Huh?	Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Walter!	Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--	That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--	Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!	Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.	But Walter--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--	They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
That makes me feel all warm inside.	Now Dude--
They're nihilists.	Huh?
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?	No, I'm--
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--	The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Uh-huh.	Not exactly a lightweight.
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?	Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!	Yeah?
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!	You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!	WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Oh, shit.	He can't walk, Walter!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.	Hey, cool it Walter.
What's mine is mine.	Come on, Walter!.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!	It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.	I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-	You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.	Where's the money, Lebowski?
Bullshit. Walter!	This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
I'm not--	A world of pain.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.	You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
how long since he was bitten?	Minutes.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.	If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.	Like cancer with a purpose.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.	It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.	If that's true, then why'd you save me?
What do you want me to do?	I want to see the sun rise.
You came back for me.	Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?	Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?	These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Where were you, Whistler?	I'll show you.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.	We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!	Blood...
And so will we.	Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?	I should think that would be obvious at this point.
You got something in mind, Blade?	Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Nomak?	He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?	Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Any casualties?	Two so far.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.	As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.	Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.	Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --	Just do it, old man.
Get in. You’re leaving.	Wait.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.	Maybe I don't see it that way.
No longer.	Frost!!!
You shouldn't be here.	I'm sorry, I --
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --	Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
But, he could've --	He didn't. Get over it.
But he's a policeman --	He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --	Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.	There is no cure.
What are you looking at?	What do you see here?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.	Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.	If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.	Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Get out of here --	I'm not leaving without you.
How's it going, Kam?	You're a week early.
This isn't human blood.	Then what is it?
I thought you promised to give me some distance?	This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".	No problem.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?	Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.	Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.	Perhaps.
You're a monster.	Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
What -- ?	You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
So what do you use, then? A stake?	Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.	What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?	Because it means the tree is older than the house.
What do you mean?	A coward too. That's why she had to go.
No.	Closer.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--	--my God, Nick???
Domini?	Yes.
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."	Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
Yeah, so?	So whoever built this--
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!	We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
Druid Hill Park.	That's a joke?
--the witch kills children--	I haven't killed any--
Cheery little place.	It's like traveling back in time.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--	--whatever; that's her.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.	What is <u>this</u>?
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.	I want to see the tapes.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?	No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--now c'mon!	Get your goddamn--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--	--Cotter's--
Nothing. I dunno--	--you should get back into bed.
Oh, Jesus, no--	--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!	You have to go.
Beer and weed is what I've got.	Both. Now.
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?	Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.	I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
No fucking.	No.
We should be so lucky.	Butt-ugly owl.
Where <u>is</u> it?	I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Where's Domini?	My room, asleep, last I checked.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--	--Domini!
Who?	No one ever comes here.
--Cotter--	--a Wiccan--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.	No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?	All I need--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.	No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?	Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
She got <u>paid</u>.	I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Pointless.	No. I don't think so.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--	--and we brought it back with us!
What?	It touched me, don't you see it now?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.	They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--	--a <u>lot</u>.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--	--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.	That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
Domini's the only logical explanation.	We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
She's far from "fine."	You're needed here--keep watching--
"It's why the witch kills children."	I thought all witches were benign and good.
--yes--	--the Sheriff's Office--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--	--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Your mother's pastor.	What happened to my Dad??
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.	I am?
...Ray?	Yeah.
What was that?	Your husband.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?	You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.	I just gotta see a guy.
On the phone. Was it for you?	I don't know, he didn't say anything.
...Well I'll be damned.	I couldn't believe it either...
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.	...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.	Abby--
...What?	I said you're bad.
Well... what happened?	I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
...Where is everything?	In the trunk.
...So?	I think someone's watching.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?	Remy.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?	I own the place.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?	Ever durned one.
What night is it?	...Friday?
I told you. I like you.	See, I never knew that.
Sign.	I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?	Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
...Anything else?	Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?	For the money.
...What?	Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?	Of course.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?	How would I know?
What's this?	You said the usual--
Got a problem, Meurice?	No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
...Why?	You shouldn't have taken the money...
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.	What's that?
Where was I?	You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
What day is it today, Angie?	Tuesday.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.	Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.	Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?	Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
To your health, Frank.	Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.	Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?	Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I guess you've seen some bad things.	Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What is this? What color is it?	Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay?	Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.	Yes sir.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.	We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Not yet.	Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Who's this fuck?	He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Can I feel 'em?	If you want to.
Bull.	Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back?. What for?	'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.	No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
That oughta do it.	Yeah.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?	Jeffrey nothing.
Yes.	You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Do you like me?	Yes, I like you.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.	Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Nice guy.  Who's he?	Who's it, you mean.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.	Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Look.	No.
Who is Don?	Don?. Are you in with them?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?	Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Come in.	Hello.
Yes. Frank-	Frank is coming?
Do you like my body?	Sure I do.
I want you to hurt me.	No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Shut up.	Beeeee careful.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!	Just get outta my bed.
You called me Jeffrey.	I did. are you?
Yes.	Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.	It's okay. it's okay.
Shh. I'll tell you.	They hurt his head.
Hold me, Don.	Don?. Where is he?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.	Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?	Yes.
Oh yeah?	You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.	That's too bad.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?	I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?	Maybe so.
I guess you have to get back home soon?	Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.	Still, it must be kinda rough.
What happened to him?	I don't know. he moved away.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.	Yeah. Good bye.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.	Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Now, how are you going to do that?	Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.	Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
What's the plan.	First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.	Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.	That sounds good.
Okay. thanks.	I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?	Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You want a Dairy Queen?	No way. I'm about to blow up.
You want to tell me about it?	. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Wow. Should you tell my father?	I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.	Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.	I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Shoot.	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.	Jeffrey!!
Okay.	What is it?
It's good to see you.	Where to?
NO.	Let's wait for some slow one.
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?	No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
I should go with her, Sandy.	Go ahead.
... Sandy?.	Go ahead!
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.	No Jeffrey!!
Look Jeffrey.	Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.	uh uh.
Are you feeling okay?	uh uh.
Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
How ya doin' Dad?	Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Well. Okay.	Jeffrey, when you see your father.
No.	Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.	I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!	Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.	Yeah. okay.
What are watchin' this junk for?	You can change it if you want to.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?	Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Greetings, Mr. George.	Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.	What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.	My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.	That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.	Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Nothing like this back home.	Derek!
This is it for me.	What is?
Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.
Should we buy it?	Are you kidding?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.	Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.	Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Excuse me?	Something about vengance being best served cold.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.	What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?	What?  Yeah, sure.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?	My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.	It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Mirtha.	Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
What the fuck is that?	It's your grass.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.	You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.	It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
I don't think so.	You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.	Nice doing business with you, George.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.	Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.	It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Your offense?  Why are you here?	I don't want to talk about it.
What do you got there, Diego?	Nothing.  Just a little project.
Twenty-six months.	Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.	Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?	Because I got caught.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?	I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Oh my G-d.	Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
I know.	And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
George.	Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
There's no room.	Try the closet.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.	Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.	Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Derek Foreal.	What?
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.	George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?	Coke.
Cocaine?  How much?	I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Yeah, layaway.	The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Surprised to see me?	Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?	You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.	Oh, I see.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?	Actually, it was three.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.	Yes.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?	Yes, it is.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?	Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Freedom.	Power?
George, you look terrible.	Yeah, well...
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.	I didn't come here to drink scotch.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.	You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I'm sorry, George.	Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.	Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to California.
Just low.	You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?	Tough spot.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.	Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?	Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.	Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.	That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.	That was a beautiful message.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?	What about him?
Look what the cat dragged in.	Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I don't know.  My name is George.	I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.	She did that before.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?	My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.	Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.	Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Yeah.	Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
I don't know.	Are we gonna split up?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?	Yeah.
I swear.  On my life.	Swear on my life.
I fucked up.	Shhhh.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?	Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.	Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.	Yes, I am.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.	Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.	This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?	Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...	And you believe the NLF?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.	And here?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...	And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Which "district" do you belong to?	Second district ...
Third group. What's your assignment?	Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
With an unloaded pistol?	I'll explain.
I don't do that kind of thing.	Then don't complain.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?	No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Go away!	Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
To show them to the UN, right?	Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Where were we?	Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.	Good evening, sir.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...	A name?
What is she saying?	She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
How you doin' Mister D?	Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.	I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
So she knew about his heart?	Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.	Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?	A massive cardiac arrest.
Then how did it get into his body?	We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?	Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?	It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Objection, Your Honor.	Counsel approach the bench.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?	Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Why would she want that?	Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.	We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
You don't know what you're talking about.	Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.	The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?	No.  I haven't done it in years.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.	That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
What about Miss Lawson?	Yes.
Why not?	She left me.
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?	It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.	What did she say?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?	She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Did you suggest any?	Yes -- Insulin and others.
-- And what did you suggest?	Cocaine.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.	And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Yes.	And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.	No further questions.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?	No.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.	We dated for about a month last year.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?	I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?	I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?	No.
How do you know that?	I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
Yes -- he mentioned it.	So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
I suppose.	So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.	Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Dristan nasal spray.	Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?	No!  Why would I want to kill him?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.	You didn't know about it before that?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?	Sorry.
Yes.	And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Do you think I did it?	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Frank!	I'll have you out in a few hours.
Can we get out of here?	Sure.  Where to?
Hello?	Hi.  It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.	I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yeah.	Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
Sorry.	It's okay.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.	It won't be that hard.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?	No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yes -- it would be nice.	What would?
You and me -- making love.	Is that what you think I was thinking?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?	I went out on the boat.
What are you going you doing?	Are you scared?
You killed him -- didn't you?	I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.	That's crazy.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?	Yeah.
I love you.	I love you too, Dad.
Because I'm expecting a call.	-- But it's Sunday.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.	"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.	I am relaxing.
Really.	And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.	We're supposed to go to the lake.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?	He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Humped	Yes.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.	I'll talk to him later.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.	Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
I don't know.	You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.	It was a place to start.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!	Daddy -- stop it!
Did Marsh use it?	No -- never.
How bizarre!	Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.	No treasure maps, huh?
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.	Aw, Betty.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?	No. You can have them.
Lawyer here?	I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
What?!	Come here a minute.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --	Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.	That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?	I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
What are you doing?	This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.	Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.	You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Nobody did.	Was this during Betty?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.	Did we want to?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"	What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.	No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.	Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?	No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.	Oh, terrific. Which way?
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?	No.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.	Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?	No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
He's very... clean.	Clean?
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.	I feel so embarrassed.
Help cook?	Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Why did you stop?	My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Do you miss it?	I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
I'm sorry. That was...	No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?	Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
You really don't need anyone?	No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.	No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?	Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.	The light was fading. Huh-huh.
It's Robert.	Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Would you like a beer for your bath?	Yes, that'd be nice.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?	No. I can't. Not yet.
Yes.	How about Bari?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.	Why?
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?	Near the church.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.	What?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -	Well, what is this?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.	To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
What do you want me to say?	I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.	No one's asking you to!
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?	What about us? What about me?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.	But now that you have it -
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?	Yes. And I've accepted.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?	Nah.
Okay.	What's her name?
About an hour ago.	They're not going to find her!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.	Cremated?!
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --	It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?	He yours, sir?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.	Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.	Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.	Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
You want us to move in here?	That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.	Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Where's the others?	Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Where's the gangsta of love?	Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.	Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.	Wh-wh-whooo?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?	What it will be.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.	Just try it.
Jimmy, you've got --	I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
I want you to do something for me, baby.	What?
But.	Hush, baby.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.	Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...	That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!	Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.	I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
It's alright, baby.	Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.	I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
We'll have to sneak in.	No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Are they on the radio?	Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?	My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
I'm here.	Bill!  Bill?!
Patrick, he's...	Okay, okay.  Listen:
We're here.  Where the hell are you?	Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the cash?	You got the shit?
Let me see it.	Let me see it.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.	That's the past.  It's dead.
Please...help me...	Dad?
No way man...	You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?	I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.	You was just doing your job.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.	Shit, that was fast.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!	But --
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.	Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?	The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Not really to live, just to play.	That building?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.	Evidence of what?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.	What we have to do is call the police.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?	I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?	Two point one seventy-six.
Open the case!	All right!  Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?	The same way you did before.
Caesar?  What is this?	Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!	I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.	There's no time.
They just left, didn't they?	What are you, drunk?
It's impossible!	Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Violet, please!	I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Where is the money?	Don't tell him --
Stupid cunt!	Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.	You need the money just like we do.
What did she do to you?	Everything you couldn't.
I saved you.	Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.	Shut up!
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.	I'm listening.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.	Yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.	Sure, Gino, sure.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.	No.
Yeah?	Hey, Mickey.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.	What?  They ain't there?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.	Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Is that the money?	Yeah, that's it.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.	Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Ma'am, you have to open the door.	All right.
This is a beautiful place.	...  thank you.
Who?	Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Oh, I'm sorry --	No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Yeah.	That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --	No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
No.	...  yes.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.	I'm already in your bed.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.	Shit, here we go.
Because it's the truth.	Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.	What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
I don't.	For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.	Do you think you know me like that?
You said he washed the money?	Yeah.
What happened?	Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
What time did you say they would be there?	The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Where will you be?	Waiting in the apartment next door.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.	Not Caesar.
It's me.	What happened?
I was so afraid you ...	You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
How'd it go?	I'm here, aren't I?
Done.  We go now.	Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Johnnie, what did I say?	Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?	Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.	I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.	I don't know what we're talking about.
Yes.	I thought you were never going to do that.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.	I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
-- he went inside! --	-- if we can get a clean shot --
Forget it.	What do you want to do?
So now you know.	So it's time to go home.
Keep it. 	Jason...  They can't let you go...
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.	MPG Capital.
You're a U.S. Citizen?	Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.	Right.
His brother.  You know his brother?	Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.	Really.
Was it the break-in?	Excuse me?
Jesus...	Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.	I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?	Then I'll find another ride.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.	I was shot twice in the back.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.	I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
We're about an hour away.	I can't believe I slept.
Okay, so...	Thanks for the ride.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.	Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --	-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
He's dead isn't he?	Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
What is that?	It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

What about you?	I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
Yes.	Think I could rent a scooter?
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...	Enhance it.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --	-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.	How did I get here?
You drink rum?	I don't know.
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.	I won't forget this.
...ervices.	Uh - what? - I ...
...Be back.	Thank you.
...ixed itself.	Machines don't fix themselves.
What have you got there?	Got there!
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.	Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...	I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...	Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!	Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
You are late.	Even later.
Triplets.	Really? - God, how time flies!
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!	Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
How much do you know?	Not much.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.	So how ...?
What's she done?	You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?	Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.	Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.	Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.	Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
I want to report a wrongful arrest.	You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?	If you say so.
You think these are tits don't you?	Ah.
Don't litter my cab!	Oh, sorry.
Yes, of course. Sorry.	I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
What's going on here?	What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.	Suit me?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.	Well, all wars do -
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.	Every day?
Security.	You're joking.
Shit! The house is on fire!	"And your children all gone."
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.	Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.	Go away.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.	Don't do anything silly.
What do you think? ... is it me?	You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Oh my God, a mistake!	It's not our mistake!
But if they did promote you	I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Try next of kin.	Next of kin!
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.	Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.	Here.
That's it.	You are good to me Sam.
Can I forget it?	Yes.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?	All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I know that.	All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
What! Shit!	It's what you wanted isn't it?
Lime, I need to use your computer	Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
My mother said it would be all right.	She didn't say anything about it to me.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.	I'm sorry but ...
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 	I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
What were we saying?	This isn't rare!
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.	Mother!
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.	I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Is Mr Helpmann here?	Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
My husband's dead, isn't he?	Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Uh ...	He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.	I ... uh ...
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.	I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer	Thank you for calling Cen -
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.	Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Er, don't you want to search me?	No, sir.
My I.D. cards.	No need, sir
But I could be anybody.	No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?	I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...	Monsieur. Quel numero.
Now look what you've done to him.	Have you got one or haven't you?
What the - ? How did you - ?	Emergency procedures.
Sign here please.	What is it?
The pace?	The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount	Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Can you fix it?	No. But I can bypass it with one of these
What do they want you or?	Time to go.
Thank you very much. How much will it...?	On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.	I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.	You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.	No ...
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.	Pregnant.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.	He looks like a cop.
Frank Pierce.	Mary said you might be coming.
She wanted something to help her sleep.	Mary, we really have to go.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.	Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
So, Frank, am I going to live?	You're going to live.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.	She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.	What's his name?
IB Bangin.	What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.	Oh man, Bucky.
He's very very sick.	I know him. That's Noel.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.	It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.	You never know.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.	At least he's got people around him.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.	Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
You shouldn't smoke.	It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.	She should go home.
Sleeping.	I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?	I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?	We moved out after that. Upstate.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.	I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't seem so bad to me.	Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.	We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.	No, no.
Who is it?	Frank.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.	The ghosts--
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.	Make a left here. I want to stop.
Who's that?	She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.	Thanks.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?	What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Three legs.	That's too many.
Backup?	It's coming.
I'll drink to that.	Here's to the greatest job in the world.
No.	Crazy fucker.
Where's Burke?	Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.	How can that be? He was getting better.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?	Look out!
Whatja doing?	I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
The brakes are shot.	I've taken that into consideration.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!	As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.	You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!	Frank!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.	I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Mr. Oh.	It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.	It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.	You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You're in the stomach!	You sure?
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.	No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?	Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.	Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?	Oh, God, no!
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.	Why?  What did they do to you?
You packing up tonight?	Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?	No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
He excels at gratitude.	Are you any closer to a decision?
That's your full name?	Yes.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?	Yes.
Eventually rising to...	Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Nine seconds.	Eleven and a half.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.	If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.	Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...	I didn't know you were going with him.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...	Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
How'd it go?	You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Then what was good about it?	I lost six pounds...
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.	I'm not kidding.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?	I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.	This isn't friendship.
Why not try it for a few weeks?	Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?	Well -- my wife got this new job...
Okay.	In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?	It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.	No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.	Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.	Yes.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?	No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Because...	Right there, Bobbie.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...	Bobbie, please.
Yes.  That's right.	I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
No...no.	One's enough.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.	Thanks a lot, Buddy.
I wish it were you giving the story.	That's okay.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.	Okay.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.	Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.	No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.	Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.	No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?	Yes, sure.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.	Uh-huh.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...	'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?	I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
So he was indicted?	Yes.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.	Billion.
Nervous?	Excited.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.	Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.	I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.	Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?	Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
It's not important.	Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.	Nooo.  Is it your story?
So what did you think?	It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?	Uh-uh.
What?	Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
That's not it.	Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.	Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Why?	I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?	Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
I got promoted for things like that.	Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.	You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?	You want to come?
This is very awkward.	Go ahead -- what?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.	Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.	I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
That's enough.  That's enough.	I'm sorry.
That's not true I am a sculptor!	Oh yeah?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Tonight.	What, right now?
It's kind of dark -	Shh!
That doesn't look like very much clay.	Oh it's enough...
Walter can I ask you something?	What!
Alright we're clear.	Anything new?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.	Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
See you later -	Righto.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.	Yeah it was all just an accident.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?	It wasn't easy.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.	Oh...
More champagne, your majesty?	Here here...
Did you hear what he said?	Yes Walter.
I know what it is to be ignored.	Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Walter...stay away from me!	Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...	Do you have to be so cold to him?
Are you alright?	Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...	Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Walter, what are you doing?	I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Where'd ya buy that?	I didn't buy it I made it.
Yeah.	Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?	You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?	I didn't mean to.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.	I don't have another cat!
You didn't mean to what?	Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
It's hot in here...	You want me to open a window or something?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?	N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!	Well, w-what did you do?
Police officer.	You're like an undercover guy!
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.	C-connection?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -	Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!	Walter shut up and relax!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -	I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?	No thanks.  Sounds good though.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...	Here here!
I won't say good luck, Walter.	Why not?
It's like...you've turned on.	T-turned on?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.	I can't.  I gotta go home.
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!	Well why don't you clean up this dump!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!	What's the matter with you!
I don't think this is gold.	Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?	Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Nice to feel needed.	Let's move out!
Man has a complex.	He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
No, we didn't.	Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.	That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
It's coffee.	Amazing!
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!	Get away from here.
Did you see a girl come by here?	You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Wheels?	My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Hi, Buffy.	Hi, guys.
He doesn't look fifty.	Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.	I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.	I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.	So I noticed.
You left me a message?	I'm out of here.  Jenny.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?	No...
I am a God!  A God!	I am so sure.
You want some water or something?	Water.  Okay.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?	Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Well, stay here tonight.	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?	It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Things are kind of confusing.	I'll back that up.
I didn't expect to see you.	I know.
Dress, huh?  What for?	For the dance.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.	I should have known.
I'm going out the front.	Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.	'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Bugs.	Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Like what?	Like my homework.
What are we doing?	Why don't we see a movie?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.	Wait!
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.	Yes.
Just stay away from me, okay?	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
I was a slave.	In Virginia.
How do you know all this?	I have to show you.
Where's the other one?	She --
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.	All right.
Meet me at this address after school.	I have cheerleading squad.
Why do you keep saying that?	Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
What?	We'll cover it later.
Not a pressing issue.	I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Uh... gym.	Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Put your head back.	Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.	Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?	No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.	Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.	Don't start with me again.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?	I...
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?	Not if you're careful.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?	I can't work this.
I want to die.	Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Interesting.	I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
There isn't time.	Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.	Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.	You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.	Cassandra's really smart.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.	Nicole...
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.	Really?
The mark of the Coven.	I don't understand.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.	I'm just a girl.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?	Could be.
You think so?	Could be.
Write that down.	Okay, what else?
Okay, let's go.	But --
I can't believe they still ate it.	Where'd you learn how to do that?
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?	Throw it out.
And Spring Fling.	Okay.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.	Buffy?
Omniplex?	Nee sitch.  No way.
You're kidding.	Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.	Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Environment.  That's cool with me.	Okay.
Oh, yeah!	Right!
Buffy, the ape-woman.	Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?	Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.	What?
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.	Big League pitchers don't use these.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.	Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
How was that?	A little better.
I'm yours.	Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?	No, no, it was great.
That's my leg.	I know what it is.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.	I did.
What'd he say?	He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...	You don't have to...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.	That's great!
Neither will I.	I think I'm ready for the Show.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.	That's my job too.
Your place or mine?	Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?	You got me all confused.
And now you wanta teach me?	I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?	How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?	Yeah...you a witch?
Annie---	What?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...	He'll learn.
God bless you.	She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You missed the tag!	You spit on me!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.	Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
Why you shaking me off?	I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Fastball.	Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...	Gimme that.
How come you don't like me?	'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.	You been in the Majors?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.	God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.	Go for it.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?	Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.	Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
I'm going to the Show.	Then go.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.	Fear and ignorance.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?	'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
I don't believe in fighting.	Pussy.
I'd kill ya.	From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Who you calling a "boy"?	See ya at the yard, Meat.
Well tell 'em, honey.	We're getting married.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.	Better find our bonus baby, eh?
Struck out eighteen...	League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?	I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.	Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.	This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.	You were never my guest?!
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.	He's lying.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!	Yes, you were.
A powerful man.	Philip, if you would rise.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.	But what happens when they do find out?
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.	It's a pity in this...
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?	The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?	They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.	Excuse me.
No, you're not calm.	...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Fine, fine. How's your family?	Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Okay.	You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.	Hello.
Now this is just a signature card.	So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.	Well...
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?	I don't know.
Yeah.	Ginger.
No, of course not.	You mean, I have your permission?
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.	Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.	To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.	I'm sorry about this. Really.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.	Between...
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.	Why, somebody's complaining?
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?	Nope, there's no way.
In other words, I'm fucked.	In so many words, yes.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.	Hey, Rich.
No, no it's okay.	It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.	Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.	Yeah?
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.	The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
What - what, Caesar's?	No, a...
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!	Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!	What are you -
I just told you. She called me.	And what'd she want?
Hello.	Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?	It's me.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.	Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?	Yeah, she's here.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?	I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Hey, it is my pleasure.	Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?	I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?	Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Okay. You come by the house?	I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?	Seven o'clock.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?	They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.	All right, we're clear.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?	Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?	Yeah, refill'd be great.
Half of everything is mine.	Ace, listen to me.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...	I...
...position...	'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
It's always been our policy -	No. Just stop everything.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.	...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We need this guy.	We can't get rid of him?
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.	Who's this?
I-I'll do it.	Okay. 
I'm going to go powder my nose. 	Ginger's mission in life was money.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.	I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.	Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.	I - I - I...
Understand?  I'm sorry.	No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Want to go? Let's go back in.	Okay.
Oh, it's so soft.	It's nice isn't it?
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.	But as much as they loved her...
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?	Yeah.
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?	No, he didn't.
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -	You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.	I don't need one.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.	Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.	Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
...under?	Pretty serious.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.	There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!	You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!	Get out of here!
With Jennifer.	And where'd you go?
She had the same.	Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Why do you want to do that?	You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.	Who were you with?
I was with somebody.	I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
I want you to let me go.	And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
Get - get up!	I wouldn't do that...
I wouldn't -	Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
I am not!	You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.	Let me in the house! Fucker!
Should I let her in like - ?	You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Loose machines are right back over there.	What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
All right, I will, I will.	Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Well, I... I never tried.	So, you're a righty?
Yeah.	Get out of here.
No, no? You didn't?	I didn't give 'em the m-
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.	Thanks, Nick.
You know where she gets this from!	You shut up.
What expenses?	Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Yeah, that works out.	But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.	I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?	Hi. Good.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.	You can't talk to me like...
I'm just trying to get in my house!	I understand.
Can I go in?	That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.	...fuckin' jerk-off.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.	Yeah. Fuck him.
Oh.	We're waiting on Carmine.
He's not here?	Carmine's gone.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?	I'll take care of it, Remo.
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?	Yeah, I heard, yeah.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.	I'll tell him, Remo.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.	It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.	No. I ain't see anything like that.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.	No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.	You're so nice. 
What? What?	Nothin'.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.	Yeah?
No, he's not.	He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.	Yes, you are.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.	Come on. Don't be scared.
Yeah.	A sponsor.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!	All right. Be careful.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?	I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Great.	You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
...same outfit.	But I saw something...
Come on.	What's the matter?
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.	Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?	No, Lester.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.	Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.	Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.	Lester - he called you here.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -	That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
He's sittin' by the phone -	What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!	It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -	You're driving me nuts!
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.	Listen...
They checked in alone.	Are they out now?
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.	God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Wow.	Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.	All right.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?	Two.
Mm-hm.	You know why, right?
Well, how come I laid nine?	'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Ace saw Vegas one way.	You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Come here, come here.	Get up.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.	What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
This is Nick.	Pleasure.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.	It's up to you.
Mm.	Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.	Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Take it easy!	Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.	Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!	Fuck you, you motherfuck!
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?	What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Again!	I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.	Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Yes, uh...	You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
	That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
How heroic of you...	Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...	What did you think?
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?	You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.	Uh Brock, today you are without me...
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.	What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...	We'll hunt him down together...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.	I lied.
Women, huh?	They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
We're waiting.	Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...	I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Catwomen. Lots of them!	Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
What do you want from me?	At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.	I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."	I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
God-damn..	What did you say?
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...	Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..	I got her...
Car wash, Captain?	Absolutely.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?	I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.	Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
I loved you.	I know.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.	Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...	Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...	Men, huh?
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!	You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...	"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."	Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
I don't know what came over me.	What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..	Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."	Not too cool...
Okay, deal.	"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
You're late.	Yes, Mother. Dear.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...	You going to talk all day?
Was someone in an accident?	Do I hear a woman's voice?
What are you doing on Theo's line?	Taking messages.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!	I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
Who's on the phone?	I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
What was that for?	You could've made me lose my call.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?	I didn't hurt you.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!	Theo wants to talk again.
What's this?	See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.	Or relieve me of it later.
I told you I should've cuffed him.	I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
He's seen both of us now.	Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.	Just like they say; no fucking self control.
If you know that just back off.	Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.	I improved on the fucking original.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.	Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
Lose the hardware now.	We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Any minute.	I was worried about you.  Both of you.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --	You don't understand.
Lady, try making some sense.	You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?	They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Who smashed the phone?	They're holding my husband downstairs.
I don't want to know --	My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.	No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.	They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
I'm with two friends now.	Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.	Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
26th off Wilshire.	Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.	Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Hey drop it, okay?	I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.	That makes two of us.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.	I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
What's happening?	She's gone --
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!	I'm trying to.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.	It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.	Even if you found us -- what then?
Do you know what's in that box?	I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?	To hide it from the I.R.S.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.	But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
You can't give up.	When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
What did you do?	I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --	You're all three of you in that van?
Yes sir.	Put the man back on.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.	Why can't it be her?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.	They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
So far they're keeping their part of it.	They put their hands all over me.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.	Hand me the phone.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.	There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.	A typical fuck-up.
I'm still okay.	Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Do you think they'll walk away?	Ask them.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.	The money, Nels ... ?
Any idea where you're going?	I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
What's really on your wicked little mind?	The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's your point?	We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.	Only one way to find out.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.	That's not good enough.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?	You won't live to see it.
Five ... six.	Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.	Didn't we play this scene before?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --	I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Who are you working for?	I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Twenty percent.	Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
They saw you kill the driver.	You're up on your details, aren't you?
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.	There are no guarantees in this life.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.	Some loyalty.
You should've done all this before.	I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.	My pleasure --
And then?	You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.	Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.	I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Seems like it.	Put the girl on.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.	The fuck I will!
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.	And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Yeah?	Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.	Take the 405 south.
I'm in awe.	Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?	Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
The 405 is coming up.	Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
See that, Col?	See what, Dil?
Just cut his hair, you know.	Yeah?
What you think?	Nice.
Saw that one.	What would you call it?
That's what he said. Jimmy.	Hi, Jimmy.
Maybe he wants something.	I would expect he does.
He's back, Col	Hi.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.	Charming.
Take your clothes.	Don't throw my clothes out the window!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?	Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Do you mean that?	He wants to know do I mean that.
What's that supposed to mean?	It's a simple question.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?	Not in my experience.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.	Bloody right I do...
No.	Scottish?
What was that?	They all get the wrong idea.
You all right?	Yes, thank you.
He's getting up.	You can't leave me then, can you?
Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.
You want to know how I kissed him?	Yes...
Do I?	Like you're concerned.
Did he come here too?	Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.	He did sometimes.
The thing is, can you go the distance?	Depends what it is.
Tell him it hurt --	I have to talk to her, Col --
Sure I do.	You mean that?
Kind of liked you as a girl.	That's a start.
How?	Ask to meet me again.
Do they know?	Know what, honey?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?	Absolutely.
Should have stayed a girl.	Don't be cruel.
Don't.	Okay.
She's the thing you had to tell me.	Kind of.
What you doing, Jimmy?	I'm not sure.
You'd do anything for me?	Afraid so.
You want another haircut, baby?	No. Sit down.
You said anything, Dil	A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?	Yes.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?	Look on it like a honeymoon.
Are you supposed to take that many?	Only in times of extreme stress.
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.	You knew which man?
You didn't.	I suppose I tried.
You tried.	Don't you want to kill me?
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.	He asked me to see were you all right.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.	Let me go, Dil
Then say it.	Love you, Dil.
What would you do for me?	Anything.
What's Fergus?	It's my name, Dil --
Dil!!!	I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
She was --	And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes.	Tell me what she wore.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --	Don't call me that --
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.	Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.	Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?	A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Leave us, Judie.	My pleasure.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?	Suits you.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.	What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.	No way, Jude. I'm out.
Of course. I forgot.	Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.	And what if you don't?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.	Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
So?	And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Why?	Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?	I understand.
Who is he?	Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Hope not.	Good. So what do you think?
No?	Nope. Not handsome at all.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.	So I've noticed.
What makes you think that?	They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
She's a friend of mine	Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.	How different?
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.	Shut up, would you?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.	Having a pint in the Rock.
We don't look on it like that.	I've often wondered how you do it.
That you guys shouldn't be here.	It's as simple as that?
Is it bad?	No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Don't know her.	Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?	If they kill me --
Help me.	How can I?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --	Stop that talk now --
Don't run off, Jude.	You don't know me, do you?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.	You didn't?
I never know nothing.	People. They could be looking.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.	Thought you liked me, bitch.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --	He's a good soldier, Jude.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.	Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.	I love you, Adam.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.	Can you remember anything at all?
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!	It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Now what?	Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.	Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.	You mean spies and things like that?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --	I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I believe you.	Thanks very much.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.	Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.	You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.	But --
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.	Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.	Agents.
Carson?	There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?	I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.	Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Are you sure there's no mistake?	None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
No.	Next, please.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --	Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --	Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
Around one.	The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?	I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.	Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Sorry about that.	Okay -- up there.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.	And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.	I'll take that.
Your --	The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.	I'm no easier to live with than he was.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?	Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Said what?	Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.	Who?
I'd love some, thanks.	I'm sorry.
Reggie -- open the door.	This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?	Shut the door!
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.	I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
No -- not yet.	But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?	I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.	I don't believe it.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.	But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Monsieur Félix -- ?	I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.	How much is it worth?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.	You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?	And if it is?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?	Meaning what?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.	Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
What do you mean, no?	The kid said --
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.	Leave me alone -- !
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.	But his mother --
Yes.	I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Where did he keep his money?	I don't know.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --	A letter? May I see it?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.	Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.	And this?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?	Why, do you think we're going to?
Please, not on my account.	No, you see, I don't really love him.
Doing what?	I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
We'll find you a hotel.	Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Hallo, Peter.	You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?	Starting tonight?
What are you doing in here?	Having a nervous breakdown.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.	Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.	How do you shave in there?
On the street where you live.	How about once more around the park?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.	Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Nothing. Good night.	Good night.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.	Be careful, Peter.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?	I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?	Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.	I believe what he said.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.	Words can hurt very much.
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?	Please stop -- please!
Can you give me one good reason why I should?	Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Have you no idea who could have done it?	Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?	Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.	Who invited you?
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.	We want that money -- now!
I think it's funny.	Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?	WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
I get all your CDs.	Not my imports.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.	Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...	Calm down Brent.
Hi honey.	Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
Not much further.	You never went, uh, all the way?
Who is she Daddy?	Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Did you warn her?	No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
She's not here.	You know where I can find her?
Can you describe her? How old was she?	I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?	No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
No.	Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Really?	Yeah. You should check downstairs.
Why?	People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
You gave me a 'D'.	I'm sure you should have failed.
of COURSE. You're not scared?	Of course I'm scared.
Yes.	I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.	But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.	Does she fuck?
Oh nice save.	I was desperate. It was gross.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.	Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.	I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.	There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
You ok?	FINE. Are you?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.	You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?	No.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.	So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I got to get home.	Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I heard you got attacked.	I did.
You know I want to go with you.	I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
You flaunt some slut in my face.	Sharon's far from a slut.
My dad's down there!	He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Mom?	Yes?
Did he say anything else about her?	No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.	Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.	The word is Mob.
Who?	The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.	You're not telling me something.
Yes.	Who was the fourth?
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.	Did you want one?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.	They're tasty.
Maybe it won't stay in.	Maybe you better just drive me home.
Unfair?!	Yes. Unfair to me.
Where's Sam?	Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.	Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since today.  New policy.	
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.	
Well, he told me to collect cash.	Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...moron.	Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Uh, huh?	Except for the fact that I need cash.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...	...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
What did I say?	Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...	...and a shitload of ice.
All right.	
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.	You want cash?
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.	No.
All right, then how about this?	Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
...up.	Are you kiddin'?
	You'd better coast through...
...town. 	
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...	...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.	Borrowed.
...-damn!	Okay, okay! 
	You're nuts, goin' back there!
Okay!  All right!	
...-er!	Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.	Well, then, that means it's call...
Holy shit...	...man!
...up!	
Come on, old...	...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!	All right, you got it.
Oh, shit.	  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!	
Come on, old Pete.	Come on!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.	 Oh...
Get over!  Get over!	Come on.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...	...Pete!  Come on.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...	...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on...	...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!	Whoo!
 Okay.  That didn't work.	 Gee, you think so?
...ho!	 ...shit!
	 
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 	Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
He's crazy!	I'm crazy?
You're--?  What?!	
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.	This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
	Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?	You're fucked, man.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...	...stole the truck.
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...	...piece of shit was worth.
	Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
...deal with this asshole.	Even though it is nice to see Andy...
	Are you all right?
Arlo, shut up.	
We're gonna die!	We're gonna die!
	 Come on!
	Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Arlo!	
Oh, shit.	Okay.

Mason.	What?
	
What?	It's working.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What'd you come back for?!	Why'd you stay behind?!
We're the shit.  Bigtime.	They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...	...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Thank you very much.	What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...-tiatin'.	Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.	But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.	That's bullshit.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.	 big balls.
	To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.	I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...	...help you?
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.	  Hey, actually...
You got a prob-...	...-lem too?

We've got it...	...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!

Yes, sir.	If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...

No!	No!
...about--	There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
No, go--	You look good, Richard.
...-ple.	Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Mm-hm.	Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
...always done, Richard?	Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
All right.  After they put you away...	...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
	Forget about him.
I can't say it's a surprise.	And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.	Closin' down, sir.

How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?	Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
They're calling it an accident.	Who's the investigating officer?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.	Do you know him?
Oh yes.	Where from?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.	Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?	Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.	His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.	You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?	Yeah.
No.	When was the last time?
Just find the girl.	I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
How do you do that?	Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
Of course I do. Where are you?	At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
What are you talking about?	Just bring your checkbook.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.	You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.	Thanks. You know something, Jake?
...No...	You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
How much do you owe me, Curly?	Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Thanks, Lou.	How'd you get past the guards?
Congratulations.	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.	Who?
What are you doing here?	Didn't you call?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.	You accusing me of extortion?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.	Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
I know what he says.	Shut up.  Go on.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.	What for?
Well, let's go.	Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?	I guess not.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...	But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mr. Gittes.	Well yes.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?	I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
What?	I said I'll drop it.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?	You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.	Well, how much would you like?
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.	How did you find out?
Mr. Gittes.	Did he know?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.	No. I'm just a snoop.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.	No, not for that one.
How did it happen?	Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?	Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?	No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?	No.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.	And Hollis knew about it?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.	They can't be.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?	What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Hold still. Why?	You can't always tell what's going on there.
Where are you going?	Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
I know.	He owns it. You know?
Yes.	That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
I can't...	Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.	...That's not what I meant.
Let me handle that.	I'm all right.
Walsh here?	He's in the dark room.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.	What'd you expect? That's his job.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.	When did you come in?
Oh my goodness.	Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
There's just one question.	Of course.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?	We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?	I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.	J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
He never even kids about it.	Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?	Hope so. He's working for us.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.	Only when I breathe.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.	Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Jake, what're you doin' here?	Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah.	Drowned, too.
The L.A. River?	Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.	Who?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?	Mr. Gittes...
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.	Yeah, I'll do that.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.	Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.	I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.	I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Neither do I.	No, you have a press agent do it.
That right?... She used to be some looker.	She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.	You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.	We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.	So I can have these? 
What are you doing here?	I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!	Then why don't you change jobs? 
Yes. I want proof.	For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
Now what can you see?	Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.	I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?	Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 	Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Father, I have sinned...	We'll talk about that later.
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!	That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
So what'd they say?	The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?	Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.	Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 	It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
That's fine, Mr. Kane.	I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Three cents.	Two cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.	Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -	I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.	These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.	You don't really think so?
Go in and ask him to hurry.	Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?	That's a long story.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.	And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Who else did you see?	Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.	I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!	It didn't end very well, did it?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -	I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?	Yes.
What's happened?	I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.	Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!	Mr. Kane is finishing it.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.	Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.	I don't my plans myself.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -	That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.	Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
But, Mr. Kane -	That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!	We've got a nice plant here.
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Has he said when he'll finish?
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -	Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Almost two to one -	I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!	Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
I know it is, Brad -	He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -	You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
You've got some on your face.	If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
What's funny now?	You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
Oh!	You're no Venus de Milo.
A chicken?	No.  But you're close.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -	You really don't know who I am?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?	Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?	Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Would you sing for me?	Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0	That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
I mean in New York.	Half past eleven.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.	I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -	You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!	Susan!
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?	I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.	Thanks.
You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.	Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?	They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.	All right.
Oh, yes, sir.	Do you know what that is?
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -	How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.	Yes?
I'd like to talk to you about that.	Go ahead.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."	That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
All right.	She's going to leave you -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.	Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?	Yes.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?	Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Oh, yes, the bonus.	It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?	Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -	You won't be lonely, Charles...
Mr. Leland, you were -	You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Sorry, Mr. Leland.	Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
What's this?	It's a letter from her lawyers.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -	That must have been love.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.	Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Thompson!	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.	Queer?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.	He married you, didn't he?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?	Rosebud?
How long have you been smoking?	What is this, a poll?
Thanks. Have a good one.	Do you mind if I drink this here?
I think you'd better leave now.	You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Dick.	Exactly.
So where is he?	He went home to change for the big date.
Am I missing something here?	I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Why?	No, don't!
My God. I haven't seen you since... 	Dante. You've got a customer.
Train. It took eight hours.	I can't believe you're here.
You saw it?	Very dramatic, I thought.
I'm not pregnant.	Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.	How do you know that?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.	So you're really getting married?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I'm giving him his ring back.	What?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?	Jesus, you're caustic.
You work in a market, all right.	Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
You're such an asshole.	I'm just kidding.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.	I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!	It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?	Was it you?
Then who operated the store?	Nobody. It was closed.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.	We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!	I can pass!
Like you're better!	I can whip your ass.
That's easy to say from over here.	Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.	"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.	This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
You only brought one ball?!	I thought Redding had like three balls!
Someone jammed gum in the locks.	Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.	Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.	What do you two fight about?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.	That's cheating?
All four?	You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
Empire.	Blasphemy.
What's that?	All right, Vader's boss...
Yeah.	Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.	Basically.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.	All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
What's he looking for?	He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.	I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.	Can we talk about this later?
There aren't.	How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.	Let's hear it.
Vermont?	Can you believe this?!
Don't yell at me, pal.	Sorry.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.	Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
What!?	Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.	I'm going with you.
I can't close the store.	You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Shut the hell up.	Bible truth.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?	No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.	I never tried it.
Her fucking body fell out!	So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?	Exactly.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.	I don't; you did.
You're lying.	I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?	Because I'm happy.
Now I know you're lying.	I'm not. She just left.
You're kidding.	I'm not.
Hey, what about Veronica?	No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You just fucked a total stranger?	Shut the fuck up!
She said she did all the work.	WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.	What are you talking about?
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?	Leave me alone.
Who're you kidding? You can so.	Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Lovely story.	Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
To talk to you.	Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
It's not like I'm miles away.	Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
To say the least.	Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
He's got those love handles.	I don't have love handles.
Do I know you?	You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.	Jesus Christ, what next?
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.	What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?	Yeah?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.	I'm not dealing.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?	It's not my store.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.	So.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?	I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.	I don't know. I wasn't watching.
You used to go out with her?	We were going to start again, I think.
Be careful.	I'm trying.
Actually, it is kind of rough.	Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.	I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.	The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?	Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
What were you doing?	Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?	Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
You're trusting.	Why do you say that?
I was kidding.	Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Three?	Three including you.
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.	I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
They put up the least amount of struggle.	After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Why do you call him that?	Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
You sucked that guy's dick?	Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.	Please calm down.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?	Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?	Um. Thirty-seven.
What is it?	Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
What did he say?	At least he wasn't thirty-six.
A couple...?	I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!	I don't want Caitlin...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?	I don't want to go back with her...
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.	Veronica, I love you...
I'm not out of shape!	Can I have your name please?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!	An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Is he staying here?	He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?	I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
I think the lady called it.	My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
I beg your pardon!	Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.	You're gonna be at John K's party?
And... he told you all of this?	Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I... I don't know what to say.	Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!	Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Dental School.	You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I have first dibs.	Says who?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.	Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks?	Twenty bucks.
Willam!	Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 	Do you still talk to Sylvan?
C-4?	More bang for the buck.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.	Where's the radio?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.	A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
I'm coming out!	No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
What the hell are you doing here?!	I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--	When we get this group down, I'm gone.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.	And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.	Would you?
What are we going to do?	Give him the money.
I'm going with you.	Not on that leg.
Two...	That's it, you look like a professional.
Do you see them yet?	Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?	Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 	Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?	Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.	I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?	You couldn't.
Excuse me?	Why are you yelling?
A flare up...	Flare up of old emotions...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.	No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.	He doesn't want my help.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.	He can handle it.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!	You got to go back now!
Let's be creative.	Excuse me?
Remember the first time we came up here?	Of course I do.
She's a lyin' bitch!!	Get it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?	I don't know.  I don't know.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.	Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
What about you?!	RUN, DAMMIT!!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.	I burned it.
He'll freeze.	Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
What's he doing?	The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?	No, he's gone.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.	We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
He never hurt anybody.	I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!	What are you talking about?
What's your names?	Tucker and Walker.
On top of the peak.	It looks like a winding route.
Right.	Then it's a deal.
Travers!  Hurry it up.	On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Why didn't you send the money over?	Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
What's the delay?	Let's move your ass in there!!
Get off my back, Qualen!	I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
This way.	Then go fetch.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!	Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
You got what we need?	No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.	A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.	You bastards... bastards.
No, my health doesn't allow it.	And you, sir?
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!	Thank you, sir.
Help you.	Who are they, sir?
So this is the young man?	How do you do, sir?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.	I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.	Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.	Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.	To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.	That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?	That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.	Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Not tonight - not this nochy.	Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.	Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good.	Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Thank you, sir.	I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
What job and how much?	You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?	Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?	Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.	Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
What do I want?	Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Yes sir.	Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.	One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
You're absolutely right, sir.	Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.	How're you feeling this morning?
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.	What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.	I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
How are you feeling today?	Fine. Fine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.	Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.	That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. What do you want?	Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Fucking hell...	Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?	Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.	Good. I'm glad
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.	Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?	Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.	The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.	Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.	Prison custody?
Sir, 655321, sir.	Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.	I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.	No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.	What?
You like Bach?	I used to play this piece back in high school.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.	Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
You like being a lawyer?	You psychic?
You need a vacation.	Just had one.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...	Sure thing.
Max, the cab driver!	Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...	It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
...he's two floors below you.	In my office?
Where are you, what floor?	Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!	Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.	You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Get outta here!  You and Louis?	Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?	I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?	Can't say that I do.
What?	I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.	Wouldn't dream of it.
Something going on?	Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...	...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...	So?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?	No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...	Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
I never bought that.	Oh?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.	Pick me up in five minutes.
What if they're wrong?	Not our call, Phil.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!	What happens if you don't?
He's not paying you one cent!	Who the hell is this?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...	...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
It's home.	You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You on some kind of work plan?	You mean like benefits?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...	Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?	Two, two-fifty.
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.	You always stutter?
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."	You're cool.
Got it?	Yeah.
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...	...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.	How can you kill him like that?
I don't know any Rwandans.	You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...	I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.	Why?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.	It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
So what?	I need the job.
Another collateral.	What?
Collateral damage.	I don't understand...
Let him go, Vincent.	You mind?  I'm working here.
Max?  What are you doing?	Leave me alone.
Don't even think you're walking away from me.	<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Mom, Vincent's not interested.	Oh, I'm captivated.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.	You'd do her a favor.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.	She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.	Yeah?  What happened?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...	What happened?
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?	See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
How long have you been a hit man?	Why?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.	Makes two of us.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?	Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?	I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Who's Heller?	That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Yeah, that.	Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?	What happened to you?
As in...? 	Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?	None of your business.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...	Slow down.
Slow the hell down!	What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
What happened?	Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.	Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
You going to warn him?	I can't promise you anything.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.	I'll see you tomorrow.
People do have heart attacks.	Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.	For what?
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.	Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.	Do they have a secret handshake?
So why are they after you?	I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You okay?	Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.	Can you prove any of this?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?	Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Who are you, Jerry?	Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.	Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?	It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Did you see the van back there?	What van?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.	I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.	Realized what?
Cold War's over, Jerry.	So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.	Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.	A water main broke.
You will?	If that's what you want.  Yes.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.	I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?	Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?	No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Now what?	This way.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.	You go.  Send me a postcard.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?	He gave it to me.
Blue moon... Blue moon...	Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
How did you know?	I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
I love you, too.	Now she tells me.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.	You've never seen her run.
Liza Sutton is dead.	Then I can't be hurt anymore.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?	Well, I don't know if --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.	I don't know...
Then screw you.  I'll rot.	Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
And you feel bad for it?	It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
And you have no idea where he lives?	You've asked me that one three times.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?	Excuse me?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.	We're very specialized.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?	Yes, that's right.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --	I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.	I don't understand.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?	Working.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.	Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Liza, settle a bet for us.	What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?	Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.	This doesn't make sense.
Jonas?	It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?	You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
That you come with me.	I don't think so.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?	Yes, sir.
He died...  ... in 1972.	Yes, sir.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.	Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Hope there's a cartoon.	How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --	Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.	What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Pepsi?  Tequila?	No, thanks.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.	Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.	David --
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.	With me.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.	I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.	Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.	Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
You aren't staying?	This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.	Good luck, David.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...	What would you have me say, David?
What does it say?	It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.	How soon will you be able to decode it?
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.	Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
What...	In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
What?	We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
How can that be?	I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
J39 Z186...?	Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Dr. Cullers?	Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Can't we get rid of them?	It's a civilian facility.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.	It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!	You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.	Is that your official response?
Could we hear to the moon?	Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.	I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Am I one... or many?	The librarian... or the library...?
You live here.	I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?	I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.	It's so... small.
Why don't you come back with me?	Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...	And?
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.	Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
The V.L.A.?	Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !	Actually --
You sonofabitch.	That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
It's good to see you, Ellie.	You too.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --	Wait -- hold on a minute --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?	That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.	That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.	Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --	If you came back.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...	Thank you.
What...?	I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?	I'm sorry -- I can't --
I'm assuming you read my deposition.	It was quite a page turner.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?	I'm not sure it's come to that.
But --	Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?	Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...	Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.	Meaning...
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --	Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.	I got two years.
You never thought that's a heavy load?	We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Yeah.	What are you doin' here?
No.	Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.	Gotta go, Arletta.
Go hard!	Ram it in and break it off!
We saw the broads.	Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.	I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.	Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.	I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Borrowin' or payin' back?	Borrowin'.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...	I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Lemme see it!	Get away!
Oh lookit that brunette.	Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
Somebody say somethin'?	I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Whatta you so happy about?	I just always did like truck rides.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?	Fifty's a nice round number.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?	Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.	We got it locked in the sock.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.	Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Luke. Where you goin?	On my own.
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.	He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!	Forty-five.
Man, it's so hot.	Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter again.	Call.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.	Well, how far didya get?
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.	A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?	Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?	Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?	Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?	You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Who are you?	Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I never hurt nobody...	Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.	You get me out first.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.	What Friday?
Where is it?	I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.	He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
She's supposed to have it.	She don't want it.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.	You come and visit.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?	Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.	I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.	That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...	I think this is number three...
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.	Is he out?
Why imitate a dead serial killer?	If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
We'll show that to...	Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.	Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.	You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Who turned off the Internet computer...	I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.	That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...	Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
What's that siren?	One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!	He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
Who's the married man?	What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...	Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?	W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.	They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Are you always so bold?	No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
He was in my apartment!	I know, baby.  I know.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...	He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
It's none of my business anymore...	You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!	Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Answer it.	I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...	It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Snotty neurotic bitch...	Classy madonna.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.	Honest to God, Ruben!
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...	Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!	Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.	Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...	I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
There was no sperm.	The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
How about I put Nikko on it?	That's always your privilege, sir.
Oh, maaaaan?!	What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?	You're damn right I do.
Where you going?	Helen Hudson...
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...	I gotta have Ruben, and a...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?	"Spokes<u>person</u>."
Detective Niccoletti?	What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?	Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.	And her husband? What was he?
It's about time.	It is?
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.	Are we imagining it?
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.	We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Isn't that rather too close...?	That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.	When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?	I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
You're kidding.	Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?	I live in my car. This is my workshop.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.	You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...	I did this already.
Patient.	What?
What kind of place is this?	I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Do we have to talk about this?	I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.	We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.	Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.	All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
How?	I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Really?	Truly.
How can I help?	Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.	I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Do we have to talk wedding details?	Oh, no, of course not.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?	You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.	I know.    I know.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?	I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Are you sure, Dear?	Come on.
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.	Wow.   Congratulations.
Mom, please.	Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I gather he's late as usual.	Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Yes.	But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.	I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.	Don't be fresh.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.	It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Chair, cup and ball.	Terrific.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?	By color.
What have you done with the ring?	It's magic.
Guess which hand.	Enough with the abracadabra.
For a price.	Good God.
A small price.	I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?	Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.	Break up?    They wish.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.	I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.	How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.	Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Tell me all.	I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Where to?	I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?	I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Not yet.	I'll be forced to tickle you.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.	Sounds grim.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.	You don't have to take care of me, you know.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.	Coming.
What is it? Are you OK?	Always the drugs.
What?	I saw you talking to my Mom.
Silly, silly, silly.	I think I should call someone.
I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.	Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
What are we going to do?	What do you want to do?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.	That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?	Oh, ok.   Maybe.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?	Sure. Of course.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.	You can get out of the dinner.
Sure. Why?	I'm going to the store.
Are you all right?	That's a big question.
Have you been seeing another teacher?	No.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.	He's a patient here.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?	I love him.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?	I start on Monday.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.	I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.	I'm glad you're doing well.
Agent Hadley.	Do you know who this is?
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.	You killed her!
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.	Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.	Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?	Not today.   Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.	Where did they go?
Hey man, you can't do that!	What?   This?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.	You're there now?
Oui.	You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.	My number's going to show up on his bill!
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.	What?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--	-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Why are you here?	To tell you that we're interested in the property.
And?	And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
They're gonna be what?	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Uh, no --	You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?	He missed three weeks.
Why didn't you tell me about this?	You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?	I guess we're going to find out.
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.	I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.	You want me to help you get out of the country?
And for my help I would get what?	Half the tapes.
I only have your word for that.	I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
For what?	Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!	You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Yeah.   We just go home.	We can't.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.	We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.	Cops?
Bring me the scissors.	And the Vodka.
I thought they came with batteries.	I can't believe you didn't check.
That moron.	It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
We still have to get out of here.	Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
This is Zero.	Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.	Good idea.
It's not?	That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?	I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.	He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.	You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?	I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
Why haven't you turned us in?	I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.	Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?	Hard to say.
Everything.	Boy, you must be pissed.
And the other car?	Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?	No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?	A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
The map said to go left.	Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
What do we do?	I was told to take what we have and go.
No, I didn't.	Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.	I see.   A master criminal.
They don't serve wine here.	What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
This kind.	Okay.    I will have a beer.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --	C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?	Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.	She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.	This is the only American car you've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.	I'm not going to leave you.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.	How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
How about Canada?	What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Going somewhere?	Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
-- I want to be Elvis.	It's my idea.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?	
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."	Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
No.   It's mine.	The hell it is.
Fuck you, grease-ball!	Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Mr. Zammito?	Uh huh.
No shit?	The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
How are we going to do that?	I know where she went.
Holy shit.	What?
And how do we do that?	I don't know.
You ever hear of jet lag?	Take a nap.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?	Something like that.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.	It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Sounds boring.	It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Who are you waiting for?	Stick around and find out.
She seems pleasant enough.	She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Who are you?	Wait!  I'm a friend!
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?	I do as I please.
Do you think you are a real master?	Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.	I'll never live as a thief!
Hello.  What is your name?	Long.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.	Don't bother.
Please sit.	I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?	You're too young to understand.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.	Really?
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!	Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.	So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
I've missed you.	How so?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.	Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Give it back!	Kneel!
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?	It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.	Give me back my comb.
Don't send me back!	You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.	I will.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?	"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.	I left the training early.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.	During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
What was it?	Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.	Perhaps.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.	You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.	Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.	That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
What happened?	Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
Save your strength.	My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.	That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.	A murderer?
It's Jade Fox!	We must avenge mother!
They're gone.	What does it say?
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.	Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
I don't know...	Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.	When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.	This is a delicate matter.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?	What do you have in mind?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.	Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.	Annie, I need a file.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.	I knew that.
Could be.	You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.	Fucking A, my friend.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.	I saw it, too.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --	I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.	Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Mom --?	I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.	She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?	I think he's yours, now.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...	And she'll be alive.  Up here.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.	Mom tried to cook.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.	I don't know you.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.	Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...	Victims.  Aren't we all.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...	Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.	T-Bird?
I wish to possess what you have now.	I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Neither.	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!	Does it hurt?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?	Shelly?
Miss her?	Yes.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?	Go away.
You'll be alone.	I'm already alone.
What... the hell is that?	This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
That thing is poisonous.	Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...	I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
We've got company.	Is he inside?
I've got him if you want him.	No shooting.
An unexpected pleasure.	Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
I'm Kathryn.	Annette Harrison.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.	Really? I thought he said it all the time.
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.
Got a boyfriend back home?	No.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?	I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Oh really?	Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?	It's not really important.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.	What'cha reading?
You've read The Fountainhead?	Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Romantic? He rapes her.	That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.	Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.	Please.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.	You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.	Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
How's the water?	Refreshing.
You're naked.	It's my house.
Need a lift?	No thank you.
And that's a bad thing?	I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.	Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?	It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
I'm... I'm alright.	How was your date?
Okay?	What are you doing?
What are you reading?	Of Human Bondage.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.	I can't win with you.
Lighten up.	I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?	No.
I just came to say goodbye.	Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.	I think that's for the best.
How am I a hypocrite?	Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.	Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.	Yeah, me neither.
Why are you trying to hurt me?	I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
But you knew this was important to me.	What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.	I'm sorry about that.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.	Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Those are my letters!	Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Really? Bulimic headcase.	What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Are you for real?	Do you want to learn or not?
See that wasn't so bad.	It was nothing.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.	Okay.
What are you saying?	Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.	Why?
Who is it?	It's Kathryn.
What do you mean?!	I... I don't think you want to know.
It's like a secret society.	That's one way of looking at it.
And then I can go home?	Of course. I'm not a monster.
Just a kiss, right?	I swear.
I think that's all the time we have for today.	Same time next week?
Nudie pictures, what do you think?	Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Greg, is that you under the covers?	Get out of here.
Positive.	Did you do everything I asked you to?
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.	I told you I don't know.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.	Racist piece of shit.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --	Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Sorry.	In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.	Sounds intriguing.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.	Shut up and turn to page 64.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.	It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
You would not believe what--	Shhh.
What's wrong with you?	You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I'm at your service.	Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.	I hate it too.
Any day now.	Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
You amaze me.	Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Shut up.	What's your problem?
Morning!	Morning.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.	Where'd she go?
Bad time?	Kind of.
You didn't?	Oh yes.
Why so nervous?	I've never done this before.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.	I have a flair for drama.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.	I accept. Now get out.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.	That's beautiful.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.	Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
What about her?	Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -	Annette! Annette!
Uh huh. You beat me three times.	I did?
Did she show up?	Nope.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?	I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.	You're a lucky guy.
Hey Ronald.	It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
Ronald, I'm sorry.	You bastard!
Oh, hello.	Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.	What do you mean?
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.	I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
What song, dear?	The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Did your wishes ever come true?	Sometimes.
Where did you get this ring?	That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?	At the old house with the voice.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.	I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
She was very pretty.	What's her name?
Irena.	Irena.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,	Times have changed.
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.	No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.	But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.	I'm never unfair.
You're shouting at me.	I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
I haven't had my breakfast.	Well, you know where it is.
Where did you get it?	Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.	I suppose so.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?	Yes, daddy.
Did you mail then?	Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?	I'll show you.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.	I didn't forget.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.	Daddy, it's true.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.	But...
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?	No.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.	Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
I've wanted a friend.	I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I shall want you for always.	For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?	No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Can't you get it, darling?	I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.	Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That's right!	This is more fun than just pretend.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!	But we don't have any sea weed.
May I pet the deer?	It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
You?	Yes, Amy.
But why?	Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?	Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.	I'm trying to.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.	Will you come soon?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.	I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.	But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.	If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
But I only came to give back the ring.	The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
I like stories.	Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Mommy read it to ne.	Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Hurry, hurry.	Yes, yes -
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.	My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?	Anybody could know that song.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.	I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.	That's from her -- that woman.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.	Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.	I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.	She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.	What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
No.	James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.	Yeah but they looked cool...
What?	Your lips look delicious.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?	Never felt better.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?	I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Jennifer?	No it's mom.
Translation: a total geek.	Anything's better than Mark.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.	So don't look in his eyes.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.	You're just saying that.
Can't you get contacts?	No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.	Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Why would they exaggerate?	To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
What the hell is the tampon test?	You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.	I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
And what makes you think you killed a man?	Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
What happened to his tooth?	I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?	You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.	I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.	Tell them you'll meet them outside.
What the fuck are we going to do?	Hide him.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.	Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I'm cleaning my stove.	You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?	I guess you'll find out.
About Benito.	Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.	Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.	Sure. See ya.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.	Hey, how about a little nightcap?
You don't have to pee.	Yes I do have to pee!
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...	You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Wow.	Take your shower.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?	Did you change your hair?
No.	No?
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.	That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.	No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.	So what book did you buy?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.	Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?	NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Uh.... hi!	Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
You had a date with Carlton?	It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?	No, but thanks for the warning.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.	This is a lot worse than "Betty."
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.	No, my bite's a lot worse.
Is that how you feel?	Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.	No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.	Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
You at least owe me the truth.	You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.	Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.	What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm going to take a shower.	Okay.
Here's a towel.	Thanks.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.	You got a dog?
No, I have a cat.	How big?
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.	Packages of money.
It's for you. Frida.	Tell her I'm eating.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?	It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
How the hell is that your business?	We're just trying to figure out what happened.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?	Why would you want to be a cop?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.	Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.	I told you she was innocent.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.	She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Madonna's in Penthouse?	Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.	And he was missing an arm.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.	Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...	She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
You think mafia hit?	Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.	Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
What are you talking about?	I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.	What makes her think that?
What kind of animal?	Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
They don't speak English...	How will we interrogate them?
Police.  Nobody move.	He tried to kill me!
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...	I don't know what you're talking about.
Please, they'll kill me...	I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
What is this place?	You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...	How could you have been so stupid?
Dammit!	Sorry, sir.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?	Patricia Crenshaw.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.	Good.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.	Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Where are we going?	Shut-up.
Why give yourself up?	I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
I don't know who they are.	Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.	Don't know much, do you?
Where do you think this goes?	It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What now?	This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
You see it?	Yes.
Where does it lead?	It must be a closet or something.
A fanciful idea, Mister White.	Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?	But I...
Water?	Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
If you like.	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Horrible...	You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
It's a trick.	No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
What are you hiding?	Nothing.  I don't know anything!
What happened to you?	I'm...  being...  punished.
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...	`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Uh --Mr. Alexander?	What?
What the hell is this?	What the hell is this ?
.. Nothing.	Great.
Just don't call him, Alan!	The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.	Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...	Mild stroke?
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?	It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...	I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Nobody's got clean kids.	We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'	I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.	He's only doing what you told him to.
What do you mean by that?	Just what you think I mean.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.	It's fine.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?	I'm not sure.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.	Choices?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?	You could buy it on payments.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...	I'm not sure... I might have.
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?	Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
In the car.	I see what you mean.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...	A teleprompter.
Presence.	Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...	But we went there.  We saw those kids.
And it's proving quite effective...	Does it make the cars any better?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.	Why?
Yes, but I wouldn't...	Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?	Certainly.
The Fidelity nonsense...	All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...	Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
You're not?	No.
Really?	We'd like to hire you.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.	What about it?
I was waiting for that jack.	I had a feeling.
Who?	The Vice-President...
Well...	Well...
What are you staring at?	Uh...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.	Go tuck yourself, Bill.
That was quite a thing you did today.	Anybody would have done it.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?	I don't know.
Where are you going?	Home.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.	Oh... Okay.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.	He wasn't always like that, anyway.
That's a secret.	You have a lot of secrets.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.	I know.
Well I guess...	Yeah... Bedtime.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.	Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I never thought I'd...	I know.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?	All set.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!	NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?	Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
What is it?	I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!	Quiet!
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.	I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Sir. It's quite clear that...	SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.	I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.	Gasparilla?
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.	That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...	He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...	The hospital? 
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.	We got a boat.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?	We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
This stuff really works? No shit?	Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
Dios mia.	I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?	You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.	Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
It's been fired.	In the battle, sir.
Tricks...Jesus...	I'm alright. Let's go.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.	Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
I'm in as long as we're careful.	Knox?
I don't know.  I don't get it.	Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Yeah.	Well?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!	Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?	Garden?
I here and now commit myself to daring!	So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Yeah?  Like what?	Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?	I told you, that's a secret.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.	But...
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.	what?!
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?	Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying	Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?	My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?	Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.	Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
You fucked up little prick!	Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
That's your sister school, right?	Sort of.
Well, sure!	Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.	Huh?
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.	Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
But I love you.	You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.	Just like that?!  You just knew?
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.	And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Yes sir.	That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?	Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.	I didn't know you taught.
A sweaty-toothed madman	A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.	Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.	Isn't there an easier way?
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?	Yeah.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?	What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Where are you going?	I'm calling her!
But father, it's not fair.	Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
You know me, always taking on too much.	Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Weird.	But different.
Want to come to the study group?	Thanks but  I'd better do history.
What?	Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.	You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?	Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.	They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...	Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.	what?
Put more into it!	YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
They are...they are everywhere.	All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.	20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.	I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...	Did you clear this?
Who gives a shit about aft?	That's where my boat's moored.
What other bunch?	The thieves.
Unless you collected on the insurance...	What are you people talking about?
Noooo!	Jesus Christ lady...
You don't have to be so touchy.	Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
I'm not rich people.	Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...	Anti social?
The "come back" kind.	How do you know that?
It's not them...it's it...	What?
You want ME to go up there?	Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...	No...
Where's you friend?	He's not coming...
Let's just keep going.	You ain't giving the orders here!
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.	I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!	Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?	Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?	A passenger...
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.	You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
What was that?	Nothing.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!	John...
She fucked us both.	Yeah.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.	Good... Pass the beer.
Damn right!	What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--	Yeah, Sal--
Who's full of shit?	You're full of shit!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?	Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
What the --!	It's Nick!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?	I know, but...
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!	Vince thinks... you know...
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?	In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!	She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
I got delayed. I --	Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
You're back.	Yeah.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.	Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
I have to go.	But you must come in.
No, I --	But I insist.
I have to go.	You are frightened, no?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?	I came to see Merle.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?	Yeah.
You like to call me Linda now?	Linda, yeah.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!	Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!	Who's got the ammo?
Where's it gone?	Inside, Vince.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!	She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.	Biederman!
How's the trailer?	Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Frost.	Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.	Naw, it's... I mean...
Nick?	Right here.
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?	I don't know.
You can do it, Sal.	No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.	I want to go home, Merle.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!	There's Vince!
Is he from here?	Hell no!
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.	Merle --
What are you, hoping?	What else?
Forget Sal.	What do you mean?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.	More bullets in the gun?
How's Linda?	Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I like it, Nick.	Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?	As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Don't worry what it says in the book.	Right.
What's that noise?	John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --	I gotta get back, Nick.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!	Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?	Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?	Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Well, who'd you get married to?	Aw, it's a long story!
Down I would say... What would you say?	Down.
Up a little there... What would you say?	Up.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.	I can smell it.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.	He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Speak up.	It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Give it to me.	When you bring in Doucet.
Hello Wade.	Out of the room.
I'm wasting time.	You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
What is it?  I'm about to go on.	We have to talk.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.	You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!	It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Just great.	NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.	Fine.
You okay?	How do I look?
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.	Keep 'em busy.
You sure?  I can help you.	Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
You my partner?	Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
I'm ready.	But Sergeant...
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?	Trust me.  You don't want to know.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?	'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?	Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Yeah.	Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
I'll have a cup of coffee?	Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
You want to be a good detective?	Yes, sir.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.	With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
What's this?	We're partners, aren't we?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.	That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
You okay?	Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
I just heard.	He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You should be in hospital.	And you should be with your family.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.	This is the guy that killed my partner.
But he was such a good cop.	They always are.
You all right?	Yeah.
Seat's too high.	My mom says I'm gonna grow.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.	Good to know you, Willy.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.	I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.	We will --
What are those people doing there? What do they want?	They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Who are these people?	They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
Jabez -- ?	I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.	I didn't.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?	Guess there will, if it says so.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.	A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --	And what about Daniel Webster?
What's that, sir?	Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.	No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?	I did not, Grandma.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?	Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Say ... about the interest ...	Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?	Sure am.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.	Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Stevens!	Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Now run along, Daniel.	What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --	Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?	Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!	What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?	I do -- and I think you should too.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.	You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Yes, why shouldn't it?	Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?	Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
No, no! Give it to me!	A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?	You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.	He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?	I'm through with you.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.	Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--	Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?	About what?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.	But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?	Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Why -- good morning, Squire.	Morning, Jabez.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --	Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.	You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?	Well -- yes --
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.	You are not so sure that he'll come.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.	It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
To save us work on the spring plowing?	You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?	Jabez!
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --	But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?	I am going to lock him up.
But Jabez, I never said that!	It shows on your face.
Mary! Come back ...	Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?	I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!	That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Helps sometimes to say it.	All right, son -- if it helps.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.	Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.	Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.	Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
What's that you say, Son?	I say -- it don't matter.
Ma -- is she? --	You'll be a father any minute now.
Hello, Sheriff.	Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.	Mary -- Jabez --
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?	Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?	Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?	Of course not --
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?	Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.	Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.	Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
You mean -- a jury trial?	I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.	Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?	The past six months.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.	So, why didn't you come?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.	You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.	Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --	We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Hans, he killed by brother --	Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
Bad for your health anyway.	Who are you, then?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?	I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?	Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
John!	Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.	Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.	I'm ahead of you...partner.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?	Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Al?  Al, you there?	I'm here, cowboy.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --	Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah?  What's the odds?	You don't want to know.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.	How do you know?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --	-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --	Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
You'll be okay.	You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.	Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.	Don't call yourself fat.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?	Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.	It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
It looks like a whole roast.	Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
What guns?	The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
I'll kiss the baby for you.	I love you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.	Yeah, well I don't blame him.
No.  Look, we're kind of....	That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?	I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Denmark?  Sweden?	I like that... yeah!
Would you do something for me? Please?	What?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...	All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Yeah.	That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...	All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Yeah... yeah!	All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Well... I don't know if I have or not.	Do you still want the operation?
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.	Oh no!
You try calling the police?	What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.	He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
Yeah.	What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?	This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.	They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?	I'm not alone.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?	What do you want to know that for?
You frisk me.	Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
He wanted to kill me!	It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.	I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
What the hell you doin' back there?	Sonny, come on out!
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...	Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah?	We're bringing in your wife...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?	He's all doped up.
I must of been outta my mind.	Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!	It's all we got.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!	Believe me, I'm on your side.
Where's the back door?	It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.	They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
What if I take you with me?	If you take anybody, please take me.
Do you think we can turn it on?	I don't know.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.	They look like good kids.
I didn't eat any pizza.	I told you, he's got diabetes.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?	You were terrific, too!
Did you know he was a homosexual?	No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.	Yeah.
I used to, but I stopped.	You stopped?  Why?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.	Fuck him - let him out!
We won't have to.	I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
He wants one.	Dead or alive?
To show that we're negotiating.	All right ... send them the guard.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?	
	... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Sal?	They gotta stop sayin' that.
Bullshit!	I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.	Okay, when do I get them?
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.	I want them all.
Oh - Maria!	Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?	Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
We can't stay here.	Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Not now, Mom, please.	What'll you do?  Come out.
Why are you doing this?	Doing what?
Robbing a bank.	I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Newsman, not ...	Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
And if you can't deliver them?	<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>

Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.	Did it hurt?
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.	Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.

I'm gonna leave now.	If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
So?	Have you noticed something about them?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.	And?
Mookie.	What?
No, you the man.	No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.	I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Good morning.	Is it a good morning?
Where did you sleep?	I didn't.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.	That's it?
Fifty cents.	You got a deal.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.	It's gonna be hot today.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.	Later.  Gotta get paid.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?	I just come home to take a quick shower.
Hurry up and get dressed.	I'm coming.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.	Stop tripping.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?	Don't worry about it.
It's dug.	Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.	Him no white.  Him no white.
Sal, can you do me a favor?	Depends.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.	Here, you gotta delivery.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.	Sal, I want my money.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.	You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.	OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.	That's it?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.	What took you so long?  Is it hot?
I've been working hard, getting paid.	Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
And I really wanted some ice cream too.	I can run out and get it.
What?	Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Feels good.	Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.	Tina, I'll be right back.
Act like one then.  Be a man.	Later.
Shaddup, Vito.	Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.	Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
You talk to 'em.	People are free to do what they wanna do.
Smack him back.	What?
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.	Ya like him, huh?
Whaddup.  Money?	I was going to buy a slice.
That's the dope.	I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.	He's nuts.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.	Forget it, Mookie.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.	Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
You really think so?	I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.	I like Mookie a lot.
Turn it off.	Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?	Too many pizzerias already there.
Take it easy, Pop.	Don't start on me today.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.	Actually we have something for you.
Hi.	Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...	Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.	I'm fine.
HARRY? Are you okay?	Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
What are you wearing?	I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.	Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.	No, I'm fine thanks.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.	I know I am, Mom.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.	Is it okay if he spends the night?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.	Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.	Don't we want them to talk to us?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!	How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.	Oh, is this your special place?
H A R R Y...	The second R is silent.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...	HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.	Now that's more of what we're looking for.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.	Who's Captain Rob?
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...	Sounds like a pirate.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...	Yeah, he's a pirate.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.	A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Don't use that tone with me, young man.	Shut up!
Collins is a great man!	Now you see why he was elected principal?
These are really cold, huh?	That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.	What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.	Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?	What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!	Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.	Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
No one knows?	Me, me, me!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?	No. What happened?
It's okay. I want the rush.	No. Look.
Hey, look. Ice cream.	You thinking what I'm thinking?
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.	How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I... found that rock.	It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!	Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Sorry, Charlie.	Hey, where'd you go?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.	That's gross.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?	Not to expect you tonight.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?	I don't know what you're talking about.
TURK, what are you doing here?	Special Needs class.
Well I was born in St. Louis.	Do you want me to pet your head?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.	Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
So could you get us into the principal's office?	Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
No, it was a complete waste of time.	This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
That's my boyfriend.	Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
He's going to be in jail for a long time.	Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Do I know you?	Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?	I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.	Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?	You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Sure.	Go in there and get us two slushees.
Hey you two. Lights out.	Hey can be on top?
Have you got what I want?	You know I do!
How was that?	It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?	We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.	People! Come on. "Parade" float.
Left here! Left!	You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!	No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...	Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.	How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
You said "aloha" twice.	Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Times two.	I think you'll make a good teacher.
Knock knock.	Who's there?
So what do you keep in there?	Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Everything?	Everything. Just for the record.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?	The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Yes?	Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes, my Lord.	We are alone...
We have just folded space from Ix...	Yes?... How was your journey?
Yes, Sire.	It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.	Is this what you seek?
Don't you trust your own eyes.	They said you were dead.  They said...
No, but many consider my training valuable.	I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Do you know this my lady?	It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.	Your Reverence.
He knows.	You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.	 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?	Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
You've worn a stillsuit before?	No.
Will we see a worm?	Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Long live the fighters!	Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?	Pain.
It burns.	SILENCE... SILENCE.
Did they try and fail?	They tried and died....  Jessica!
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??	I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
No.  I don't work here.	Huh?
Who are you?  What do you want?	I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.	Do you want me to get it for you?
Are you sure this is okay?	Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.	Ah, so I pull the strings!
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.	Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!	That's good.  I could use the money.
"It is my home."	"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.	That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
What is this place?	This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?	Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?	You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Goddamn, it's cold!	Once you're in it, it warms up.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?	Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.	It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?	Formaldehyde.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.	Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.	Really?  I don't feel so great.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?	No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
And, cut...	Eddie, how was I?
Last night was quite a romp.	Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?	What do you mean?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.	No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.	This is the big moment...!
Wow.	And who may you be?
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.	It's that easy?
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?	I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.	Isn't he?
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?	Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!	Better than not getting a job?
No!  A horror movie star!	Boris Karloff!?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?	This is my way of telling you --
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?	Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.	That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.	Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!	Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
But there's plenty of other parts.	Like <u>what</u>?!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.	That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I'm going to my mother's.	Does she have room for me?
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?	Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.	What other sixty-thousand?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.	That's not true --
Really?!  Well good for you.	I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!	Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.	Da pleasure be mine.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.	Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.	Okey-dokey.
Hey!  You're not eatink.	Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Tor, I should be getting home.	Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!	It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??	Tits.
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.	Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??	Who?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!	There's still a sex-change --
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.	I don't think he's a schmuck.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!	I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.	Maybe it needs special handling.
What are you making?	Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
You look beat.	I am.  How's your father?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?	Not good...
What was that?	Bela died.
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...	Well you tried --
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!	So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?	Yes?
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?	You don't wanna be noticed?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.	What's uncanny?
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.	Yeah...?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?	What octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.	So how long have you known Eddie?
Why... yes.	Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.	It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.	You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
What the heck is THIS?!!	Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?	Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
What do you love her or something?	Come on...
What?!	I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.	You're nuts.
Ed, can I see you a second.	Excuse me.
Uh-huh?	And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Yeah?	Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Leave her be.	You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Ed --	No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
He's who we want to go with.	This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.	I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Where are you going?	I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --	Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
What?	Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
You know who we are?	Tell me.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.	I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
No.	Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --	Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
How's Marcia? She all right?	I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.	Mm.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.	So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Yes.	Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Both.	Holy sh--
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.	He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.	Oh God. What hospital?
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.	Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Hi. Is Shari here?	No.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.	All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.	Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Yeah...	I hear the dog really liked him.
Why do it?	I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Oh my God.	It's... okay
Go!	All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Oh God, this is so weird.	Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
So...?	Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Everybody hates me!	No. Who?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!	Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Twenty-nine.	Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.	Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!	No... Could you?
What's up?	Where were you?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.	What are you drunk?
Show business.	You're in show business?
You would do this? You would actually --	In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?	All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?	I don't know.
All right.	Yeah?!
Polish acrobat.	Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...	No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
What is this? What's going on, who is that?	It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?	Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --	Cassie...
Cliff left her, thanks to you.	Me?!
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.	A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Hi, Shari.	Who's Shari?
Hello.	Hi.
You don't recognize me.	No. Am I supposed to?
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...	So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.	Ed... I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...	Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?	Sure.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.	That's the point -- this could change things.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?	Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Tu	pierdes.
In love?	Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
But you haven't written your novel.	That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
what?	Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.	Thank you.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?	Yeah, uh, just a minute
How'd it go?	Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!	Dick... Dick,..
What?	Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.	So nice
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.	But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Here they are.	You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.	Right
Looks good to me.	Aren't you supposed to keep them?
NO, that's fine	I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister	So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!	Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?	Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
So what brings you here?	I'm looking at new cars.
Handles pretty good, don't you think?	Yeah.
So Tracy?	Yes?
Why are you doing this?	Doing what?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?	Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.	I did it.
I don't believe you.	I have proof.
More this way.	Okay.  Give me the drill.
I can't afford this stuff right now.	Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?	Should we get a what?
points at the motel.	Oh.
Three twenty-five.	Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.	Sherry... I love you.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.	No way I It doesn't make sense.
What?	I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
These are private -- these are for us.	I know.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.	Sorry.
Who put you up to this?	What do you mean?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?	No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.	Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Yeah.	You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Can I sign yours too?	Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.	Paul, get out!
How's the left these days?	What's it to you?
Can I get you a drink?	Yeah, plain scotch.
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?	No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.	That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?	Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?	Yeah.
Did they deserve it today?	I'm not sure.
But you did it anyway.	Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.	It's Bud.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.	You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Lad, may I have a word with you?	This business, Captain?
Captain, what do you want?	Call me Dudley.
Will you work for me?	Of course... But how?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.	Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.	What was that boyfriend's name?
Where are we going?	It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?	Get the fuck away from me.
Dudley's guys.	They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.	There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.	Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.	At least not anymore.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.	We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
She's fine.	I'm not asking you.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?	You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.	He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --	I got her address.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.	And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
Should I?	His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?	Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.	He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.	<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.	It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?	The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?	Say what and so what.
Ray, we got the shotguns.	I don't own no shotguns.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.	I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?	Gone.  Not a trace.
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.	I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Ed, I want confessions.	I'll break them, sir.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.	Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?	<u>Throwing me</u>?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.	What about you?
Damnit... <u>What</u>?	I want you to follow Bud White.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?	What?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?	Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
She is Lana Turner.	What?
What's on the call sheet?	A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Decorated?	With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
I get the idea.  You got a description?	Of his penis, sir?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.	I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
How about White?	You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?	I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I'll take your word for it.	I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?	I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.	Some reality.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.	You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --	Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.	Officer White?
My daughter was a virgin!	I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.	You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?	I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
What happened with the kid and Loew?	You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.	Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'	Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Really?  How?	You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.	Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.	Oh?  Anyplace else?
DePinto's dead.	Oh Jesus.
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.	I don't know what that means.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?	Listen--
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--	Turn on CNN.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--	Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--	Do it!
I'll come straight there.	Be careful, Danny.
It is?	Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.	Rachel Banks?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.	I don't know who he is.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.	Told by whom?
Yes.	Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
I don't know what that means.	230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?	If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?	They're spooks.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.	One-twenty.
What'd I tell you?	I didn't use my name.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.	How'd you have the manpower to--
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.	Jesus.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.	They come after you?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.	Why?
Think we let out enough air?	Oh my God...
We lost 'em.	That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.	Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
These guys are incredibly persistent.	Tell me about it.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.	No he won't.
Same thing?	So what do we do now?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.	What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?	The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?	Listen--
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.	Are you sure about this?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...	Neil, thank you for your help.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?	Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
That's fine.	I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
How 'bout Christian Dior?	Is that good?
Remain calm.	Okay.
Your stuff?	The robbery.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--	I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.	What kind of trouble.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.	I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
Anything at all?	No, sir.
Uh-oh.	Listen to him.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--	Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.	Well, you know--
He's got his priorities?	There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.	I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
I think you should leave now, Robert.	Stacy--
I know, but listen--	Was that doctored-up, too?
I know.	I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.	This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.	What happened to your head?
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.	That's okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.	You opened the thing?
It's really over?	Albert's gonna get me my job back.
My suitcase--	Sir?
What can I do for you?	Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.	That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?	I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
And then what?	I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Do you like fish?	Not that much.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.	I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--	He doesn't work that way.
I know.	The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.	You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
This conversation's over.	What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.	We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!	Shut the fuck up.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!	Seat 74.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.	L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
You're learning a cruel lesson.	Are those my Christmas presents?
It's okay to use the phone.	Alright!
No, but they took my blender.	Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Can I talk to you a second?	Table 122?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.	An investigation? It was a bus accident.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.	Bobby--
I don't know. I mean--	Why would the NSA--
Jerry--	Listen to me.
You gotta--	No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
I'm sorry, man.	No. No, it's okay.
Tell me about it.	How can I reach you?
Was Zavitz in trouble?	I don't know.
You think there was a connection to--	Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
What is it you want?	Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
It means who's side are you on?	You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
What?	I said fuck you.
The originals?	There was a transfer.
Who?	Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
We'd have to--	Get it.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.	Sir--
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.	We believe?
Yes sir.	You're kidding me.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.	And if it wasn't?
Yes?	Puffed cheese?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?	No.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?	What kind of fossils?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.	I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.	I don't care to bargain.
You felt obliged to.	As the wife of one of our party.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?	He said - be careful.
Actually, you sing.	Pardon?
When were you most happy?	Now.
When were you least happy?	Now.
What do you hate most?	A lie.  What do you hate most?
I can still taste you.	This is empty, just coming!
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.	I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.	Don't go over it again, please.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?	Would you let me pass?
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?	I can't move.  I can't get out.
It's so cold.	I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Oh dear.	Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
I'm sorry, Katharine.	I know.
It's Geoffrey under this.	I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Good morning!	Could I trouble you for some water?
I was talking about the girl.	Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
I believe I'm rather late.	Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Look, either shut up, or go home.	Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…	Right.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.	I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.	Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!	Shut-up!
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?	That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Is this you?	I don't know.
Or was it Toronto?	Don't cut me.  Come on.
What do you want?	I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -	You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.	Please don't creep around this house.
Irving Berlin.	For?
Top Hat.	Is there a song you don't know?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.	Me?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.	I see.
The team is in mourning, darling.	Oh really?
Right.	Aren't you?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.	I can already see.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?	No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Excuse me -	Yes?
This is Captain McGann.	Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -	He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?	K is for Katharine.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -	Hey! -
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?	Never heard of it.
For my hair?	Yes, for your hair.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.	I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?	I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.	I should go to the house, get breakfast.
It's what I've learned.	I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Hello.	Hello miss.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.	He's sleeping.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.	Does he have to go?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.	Go away.
Yessir.	This is making me incredibly angry.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -	- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.	Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!	Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.	Why?  Are you German?
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.	Through a window.
Meaning--	Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.	You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I have a question...	Who am I?
I can't?	It's sold.
How about if I try humility.	How about if you try disappearing.
Mr. MacDougal.	You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.	Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
You have a car?	Uh, yes.
Seems I am.	I'll call an ambulance.
I've got something...	I sincerely hope so.
I didn't expect you to be so...	So what?
Do you mind?	You...you can't.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?	No. Why would I be?
The Empress Death Mask.	The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
I know.	So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
And good morning.	Good morning.
I know it well.	As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?	In a week.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.	We go underwater?
Let's do it again.	Try laps. Say a hundred.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.	A dozen times.
I trust it's your size.	It's---beautiful.
You were afraid of heights?	Terrified. Still am.
Camera in the--	Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--	In eye of that painting.
We're working.	It's a party.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.	No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
STOP! You're making...mistake.	It's your mistake.
Your share.	Get the hell in.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.	Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.	Okay, 80-20--
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--	My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?	Hold the record. Alone.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.	There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
The Mask. Where is it?	You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
What about the rules?	My job, my rules.
Well...What are we doing?	You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.	Transfer.
So how long till we do this?	We're doing it tonight.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.	There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Not for me.	What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
The sign of our partnership.	Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Put this on!	I'm not leaving without you.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.	But--
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.	Next time I'll use valet parking.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.	Which is--
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.	Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.	This is big enough.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?	It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
She's calling the shots now.	You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.	She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.	It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.	You're giving them to me?
My friend, you always surprise me.	We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.	Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.	Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?	Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?	It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --	Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.	I'll say.  Holy moley.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.	Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.	They did?
Cause of the chromium.	The what?
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.	Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --	It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.	Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?	For what?
It's a good day.  I feel good.	Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
The judge came up with a number.	A number for the whole group, or for us?
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.	Yup.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.	Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --	Where's Anna?
You're a girl.	Excuse me?
Erin, you've been gone for a week.	I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
What are you doing here?	I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?	Course I did.
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.	Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
This is the only thing you found?	So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.	That's crazy -- why not?
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.	Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.	Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --	They skipped that step.
What do you mean?	PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.	From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --	It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
And if you had to guess ...	With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Ho - ly - shit.	Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.	How do you know that?
Who's the judge?	Corey.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --	Right.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.	And ...?
And you were told to destroy those?	That's right.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.	What do you mean?
You come to the right place.	I guess I did.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.	I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Pattee?  That your middle name?	Nope.  Maiden.
You're married.	Not anymore.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.	Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.	Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?	I don't know.
What's going on in there?	Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.	You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
She's one of the sick people?	Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?	You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.	Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.	What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Which number do you want, George?	You got more than one?
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.	Why not?
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?	I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.	Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?	Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
You're around every afternoon?	Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?	What do you mean?
You are someone.	No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?	No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.	How would you know?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?	Keep your voice down.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.	Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.	I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
More than you need me.	I need it.
Thank you.	Mm-hm.
And I miss you.	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.	Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?	Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
What?	My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Dr. Paulsen?	Yes?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.	Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Oh.  Oh.	No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?	Right, I guess those are the kids --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.	You did?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.	Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Soon, Lord Vader.	Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.	Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
... Luke, you must not go.	But Han and Leia will surely die.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.	Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks a doleful farewell.	I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.	Barks his Òright on!Ó
... Like we're being watched.	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
I'm looking for someone.	Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
I'm looking for a great warrior.	A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Mine, mine.	Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.	Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
What is thy bidding, My Master?	There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...	You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
What are you so grouchy about?	Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.	I'm going to see what it is.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.	No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.	This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?	Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
You don't look angry.	How do I look?
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.	Well, I hope you don't expect more.
They're moving away.	They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
What are you afraid of?	Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
There's something out there!	Where?
Looks like some kind of Mynock.	There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.	Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?	The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.	Can you trust him?
He found him in a junk pile ...	Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.	Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
I was worried about you.	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?	Hyperdrive.
How's your mining operation going?	Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?	You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
What about Han?	I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...	... we're the bait.
What's going on?	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
What'd you say?	I didn't say anything?
Someone's falling.	It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
The deflector shields are gone.	Are the coordinates set?
Closer?!	Closer?!
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?	I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
I can't. It's too big.	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.	I thought those seekers were set for stun!
I see a city in the clouds.	Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.	It is the future you see.
They're my friends.	Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.	I'll die first.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.	Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Did you call the Zoo?	Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.	It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Who's that?	You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Ooww!	Go on now. Do as I say.
I tried...	Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.	We'll see.
Give it to me.	You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.	Can you land?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.	My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Shut up, Plissken.	What's the little black box do?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?	Having second thoughts?
Defense against what?	There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?	A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?	No.
Locked.	Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.	It's history. I gotta go.
Got a smoke?	You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!	I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.	Delgado?
Where are they going?	Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Not yet.	I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Later.	I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.	Which way?
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.	Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.	Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...	Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.	Where?
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.	Who?
Who?	The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!	I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.	The what?
What are you gonna do in Venice?	Find Cuervo Jones.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.	Thank God.
Yield. I have the advantage.	I will not.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.	Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?	We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?	It is deep...
I want to thank you.	That's not why you came.
Excalibur! Is it true?	The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Yes.	Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.	I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...	My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.	You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
What is this place, Merlin?	It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.	Not you, my husband?
Why can't you be my champion?	If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.	Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Why?	I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?	Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.	Can it truly be used for magic?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.	No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.	People make you laugh?
You are truly magnificent!	Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
You provoke me, Merlin.	What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.	I am the desert, where water disappears--
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.	One land, one king! That is my peace!
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.	Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Now you must pay me.	I?
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.	To kill and be king, is that all?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.	Well what's wrong?
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.	What's he doing there? Teaching?
No, he's working on another book.	Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.	I didn't know that.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?	Yes.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.	Thank you your excellency.
And you got an invitation.	What's this?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?	No. Not at all,
You were expecting a deliver y that day?	Not that I know of.
Oh, I see.	Want to ask him?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?	Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?	When she's well enough, I'll ask.
No. No rats.	I just heard them Karl.
There is nothing.	Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?	No thanks Karl.
Morning.	Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
A stimulant.	Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.	Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Lies?	Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
She used those words?	She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.	Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.	What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Did he tell you about my party?	Sure did.
Didn't tell you of what she did?	He didn't mention her.
On what?	The priest.
Oh yeah, since when?	Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-	Could you see her?
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.	Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.	What else?
Did you know my mother died recently?	Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?	Not at all. Why d'you ask?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.	Are you sure?
Is she gonna die?	No.
What kind of stuff?	Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Oh look at that.	You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?	I found it.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.	I wouldn't talk.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?	You like him.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.	Do you not like him like daddy?
People get tired.	Why does God let us get tired?
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?	St. Mike's.
I believe you.	College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
She seemed fine.	Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Another one. Had your lunch?	No.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.	And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?	That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
You and Regan?	You and us.
Did you do that?	Uh Huh.
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!	Who are you?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!	Uoy era ohw.
No.	I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?	Why?
Save your servant	Who places her trust in thee, my God.
And also with you.	Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
The Lord be with you.	And also with you.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?	Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?	I've seen him.
Really?	From the psychiatric end.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.	Sick priest, is that it?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?	No I probably wouldn't.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.	Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Who?	The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
MERRIN!!!!!!!	Are you tired?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!	Shove it up your ass you faggot!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.	Do you have an appointment?
Yes	Are you a relative?
How old are you?	Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?	Sometimes.
Is it Captain Howdy?	I don't know.
Give me the keys!	You're not going to drive!
Frankie.	You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.	Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
What's our friend's problem?	Teeth.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...	The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
You the magician?	No.
Oh my God ...	Recognize these two characters?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.	How we doing?
What's wrong with it?	You look like you just crawled out of bed.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.	Fuck him.
You're their uncle.	Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
What d'ya got?,	Bosen black.  Flat.
Seeing anyone in particular?	Why the interest?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.	What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.	No thanks.
We gotta go, Jack.	No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.	Says who?
I made her nervous.	What do you mean?
Yeah?	It's me.
Nice, huh?	What?
The hell you don't.	I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.	It wasn't like that.
No?	No.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.	I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.	It never was.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.	Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Awe inspiring.	Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.	She's here.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.	You wanna get a drink?
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?	Two years ago.  March.
Day.  Wednesday.	Last?
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.	A few bars!
We might as well do the towels the same way.	Okay.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.	Doesn't it matter to you?
What's the matter with you?	I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
How dare you say you love me.	It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
What the hell are you doing?	What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.	She's a big girl.
You saw wrong.	Huh?
Expensive hangover.	A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?	Yeah.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.	The tenth's out.
What do you mean?	I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
We're not getting paid then.	No.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?	A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
What?	We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.	Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Right.	I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.	Spur of the moment.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.	Yes, it is.
You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?	Don't take it personally.
So?	Uh ... we'll let you know.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.	Where's my name?
Come on.	Hey!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.	You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Right.	Piece of cake.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.	I was gonna split it with you guys.
Jack, you with us?	The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.	Hey.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?	For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?	Virgins.
He's right.	He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
I don't believe it.	I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.	Smells like fish.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?	Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, we're connected.	Great.
Is that important?	Uh, well ...
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.	Thanks, Lloyd.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...	I'll call you.
How come?	Job.
Brought it.	Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.	You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
It went well tonight.	Frank works hard.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?	He'll come around.
Where's egghead?	His kid's sick.
Can't sleep?	In and out.
How's egghead?	Like a baby. You?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.	Hey, business is business.
What'd I say?	Nothing.
You're upset.	I'm not upset.
You were good.	Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Nina?	Who's Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?	Ed? How many people live here?
Soap convention.	Soap?
My father proposed to my mother in there.	No kidding?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.	Coffee?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.	You don't pick your brother.
Vegetables.	Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.	Another five years, huh?
Guess they're up.	Sounds big.  What's he do?
My days are not the old days, genius.	What are they?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?	What's a prom?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.	He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
So. How are you?	Fine.  You?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?	Eddie.
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?	They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?	Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.	What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Where am I?	My place.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.	Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.	You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
So?	So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.	Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.	It's important.
... I was dreaming ...	Something good?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --	Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --	-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.	What more proof do you need?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.	Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
How is he?	No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?	Would it?
Which ear was it?	The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.	I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.	You said it, Jon, not me.
What -- what are you doing?	Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.	Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
Clarissa left those here.	I won't tell mom if you don't.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.	Like you know anything about it.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?	What?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.	Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.	Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.	Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
What about me?	A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Just following your example.	D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
As much as ever.  Nothing.	It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
What is with you tonight?	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?	Gone?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?	I'm not going anywhere.
You always say that -- then you leave.	Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.	The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.	Great.
I'm going to the powder room.	Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.	Back then -- who wasn't?
Her assistant?	Yeah Jack, her assistant...
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.	I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Mr. Mintz.	Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
That’s right. And auto supply...	Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.	I don’t think you’re hearing me.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.	Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.	Got it.  Good tip.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?	Great room...
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...	It’s just two kids, right?
Damn...	Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?	Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She is relentless.	She wants to have an affair with me.
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.	Hey, is that really necessary?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!	The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
How'd you know my name was Jack?	I call all you white guys "Jack."
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.	There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...	Hey...
Miss me, Jack?	That’s my car!  You stole my car!
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...	Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!	You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Finger food...?	I don’t think so, thank you...
Evelyn, right?	Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...	Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?	No, I didn’t...that’s great.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.	Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?	Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
Jack...	Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.	But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Uh...that baby’s crying...	And...?
Hey!  I was watching that!	I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?	It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
Thanks, Jack...	No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...	I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  But this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
How can you do that?	Do what?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.	Really.
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.	I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...	You had a heart attack?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...	It’s wonderful...
Good things...	What are you sure about?
I could stay here forever...	I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?	Think bigger.
Annie goes to a great school.	I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
You’re not married, are you?	No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Mrs. Peterson.	Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.	A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...	That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...	But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
For one thing, you like expensive things.	That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.	So we'll get egg nog.
That’s totally see through...	Merry Christmas...
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!	Yes!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --	I wouldn't know anything about that.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --	Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.	I'm sure he's matured since then.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.	Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
How long was I out?	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Are you alright?	I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?	Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it.  Everything I want.
What do you want, Vic?	To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."	And you can?  Power it up?
He's not responsive --	Ben!  Ben!
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --	Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
And where do we think we're going?	I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
I though we went over this.	Last one down springs for room service.
Apparently I can disappear.	<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Stop it.	Okay, "mom."
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?	Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.	<u>Girl</u>...?!
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?	Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
They're ready for you, sir.	Showtime.
Leonard, how's the feed?	Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Front page?	Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?	Hilarious.
<u>Ben</u> did this?	He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
But I'm not done with the machine --	Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.	Great minds think alike.
Which was?	Passion.
What?	We need to get past them.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.	What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --	Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...	I'm sure I can come up with something.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?	Are you kidding?
There were a lot of variables to consider --	No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --	Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.	Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --	Susan.  What are you doing?
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --	We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Okay to proceed.	Phase Two.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?	The less time, the better.
I know that. But what's the maximum?	In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.	Message to Proteus.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.	It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
Benes... What the devil happened?	The Other Side got to him.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --	What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.	And take a little trip with them...
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!	Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Listen...the Heart.	Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --	It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Doctor...	Yes, Cora.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --	No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.	I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
A long time, with one man.	Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.	I always thought it was nothing but red.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.	As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.	Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
But that isn't possible.	Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.	Yes...
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.	Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --	You left something out.
Don't tell me they're refueling...	Oxygenation...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.	Then why not take it?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.	Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.	How are you, Miss Peterson?
Sounds like heavy artillery...	It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
At this size, I would certainly think so.	If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.	Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.	They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?	Send the following message...
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --	His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.	You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.	Two in a row?
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?	Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.	I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.	It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...	Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Any reserve air?	Enough to breathe, but that's all.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...	Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
What happened?	Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!	Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What's wrong, Skipper?	What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?	On the Repeater.
That's it...	Looks simple to operate.
I'll never find my way through that.	I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.	Was there any damage?
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -	I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.	I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
...Is this a fucking joke?	Unghh... oh, geez...
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?	I don't know. Few munce.
Or your fucking wife, you know.	Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.	Yeah, you already said that.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -	I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?	Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Three people. In Brainerd.	Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.	The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
We need more -	This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!	Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -	Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
One hunnert's the best we can do here.	Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
Any others?	This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.	Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, don't be silly.	Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?	Pretty darn good, ya want some?
You're not a C student.	Uhn.
...Yah, okay...	Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.	...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -	Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?	The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -	Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Hon? Got the growshries.	Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah!	This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah.	My patience is at an end.
Shep said 8:30.	We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?	Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.	No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!	No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.	...There's a million dollars here!
...Well, that passed.	Yah?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.	You had breakfast yet, Margie?
You look in his citation book?	Yah...
Yah?	Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah, that's a good one.	Yah.
How we doin' on that vehicle?	No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
No, that's okay.	Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
...What can I get ya?	Just a Diet Coke.
You're livin' in Edina, then?	Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Nope.	Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Hello?	Yah, is this Marge?
Yah?	Margie Olmstead?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -	What'd he say?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -	His wife?
So... they didn't...	No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?	Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.	Love ya, Margie.
Hon?	Yah?
They announced it?	Yah.
I love you, Margie.	I love you, Norm.
Uh-huh.	We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And his wife?	She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?	His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.	Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
This is do-able.	Congratulations, Jerry.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.	He's at Norstar.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.	Well -
I'm tellin' ya.	Well... Why don't we...
There's no one else here.	I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.	Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Is that your blood?	Some of it, yes.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.	Yes?
It means it was homemade.	This is... really a shock...
You need to lighten up.	Can't you give me something?
We need to talk.	Sure.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.	What?
And I saw you practicing this...	Practicing what?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.	Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I want that.	You can't have the whole brain!
So far, you have four and I only have two!	Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.	The girl had done her homework.
What are you doing here?	What... ?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.	It suits you.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.	Goodbye.
Where?  Here?	Here.
Here.	Feel anything?
The Paper Street Soap Company.	Can I come in?
He's not here.	What?
What kind of stupid question is that?!	Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?	We did make love?
Say my name.	What... ?
Marla...	Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.	Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...	I'm sorry, but I...
... and you come home to this.	You fucking slut!!
How have you been?	... You know me?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...	Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...	I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.	Pardon me?
Insurance'll cover it.	Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't... think so.	This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Yeah.	So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Thank you.	You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?	I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
A nice, big cock.	Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know about this.	I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.	Where do you want it?  In the face?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.	Like hell.  That counted.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?	Call what off?
I know that.	After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Same here.	A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
Where's your car?	What car?
What are you reading?	Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Unbelievable, huh?	He was obviously able to handle it.
Promise you won't.	Yes, I promise.
Huh?	"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...	No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
... Marla ... ?	Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
I feel sick.	Imagine how he feels.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?	You know what I mean.
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.	What are you doing?!
What are you talking about?	Nothing.
"Applicant?"	If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.	Why do people think I'm you?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.	Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why did you do that?	Answer me, Tyler.
Is this really news to you?	What are you talking about... ?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.	And, sometimes you control it...
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...	But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
...stop me?	I'm not going...
...to let this happen!	Stop finishing...
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.	Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...	If you know, I know.
One minute.	I think this is about where we came in.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.	i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Please...	Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
What?	Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Why... why... why... ?	Why what?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...	I swear on my life, I won't...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...	You told me you'd say that.
It's what he would have wanted, sir.	What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
Would you rather be dead?	No, please, no, God, no!
Yeah, how?	I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.	Signs?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.	You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...	Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?	What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?	I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
What do you want me to do?	Speed up.
No!  It can't be.	I have to save Eugene!
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.	Taken care of.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.	Random, sure.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...	Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.	That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.	Carter.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...	What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.	Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?	Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.	Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
I tried calling last night but your father --	Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.	We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.	Who is this guy, anyway?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.	Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?	Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?	How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.	Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.	I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.	You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Kimberly?  It's Dad.	Hey, Dad.  What's up?
What on Earth are they doing?	Who am I, David Blane?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.	Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
That's why I was there last night.	I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!	Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Can't you open the door?!	Easy, Billy, just open it.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!	Get out! Get out of the car!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!	I wish you were on the plane!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.	I don't.
We're losing our favorite teacher.	Look, there's something you should all know.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.	Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.	Oh, you've noticed it, too?
And don't pass on the right.	Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!	'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
It broke!	No one's that strong.
Knock it off!	May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?	That's right, buddy.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.	Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Batteries not included.	This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.	Where's your stuff?
I've seen worse places.	There are no worse places.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?	Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Roundeye.	Alright.  Home run.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.	Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
You never been in one of those things.	I suppose you have...
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.	You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
Why's that?	I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Why'd they want us?	They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Thanks.	Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Christ.  How'd you get here?	Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
And how'd you sneak up like that?	Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yes you can.	How?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."	Let's get that tent down!
You pathetic scum.	Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.	I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the job?	Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Where?	Not yet.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.	We just take pictures?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.	I was crossed-trained in gunships.
All this is for us?	That's right.
Typical...	Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
How long have you been setting up?	About 22 hours on site.
Black.  No sugar.	The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.	It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."	That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?	Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Will it hurt?	That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.	This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<u>What</u>!	Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.	You still believe in God?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...	What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
I... You're not going to understand this.	Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Hello....congratulations.	And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.	Thank you very much.
What do you think?	I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
What?	"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.	Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...	First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?	I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.	Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Parry?	He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.	Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.	She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
No...no...we can't...we can't..	Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?	Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.	NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!	It was a crime.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?	You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Your name was picked.	Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Now what?	Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Oh, Lydia!	Lydia.  Lydia what?
Please don't hurt me?	"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I need a drink.	I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Have I died?	Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Hi... Where are my shoes?	They're --  -- What?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.	I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?	I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Parry.	Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.	Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
I'm not married.	Funny -- you look married.
Why did you do that?	Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.	Fifty dollars?
But I gave it to you!	Well what am I gonna do with it?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.	Who?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!	Bingo!
Happily married, probably.	Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?	Sure...
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.	What are the other reasons?
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.	I know!
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!	<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...	Got any Ethel Merman?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.	What a gyp.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.	Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Don't say that.	No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I don't drink coffee...	And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
No.	Divorced.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.	Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!	I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Now, now.	No, dammit, I would easy.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...	Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.	I hope they do.
I know you're not.	You treat me like I was.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.	You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.	Okay...
Come on.	Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Sure you don't want anything?	Fill it up.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.	Who?
Well...	It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Hey, mack!	Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.	I didn't get it, did I?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.	I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
You want me to hold the chicken.	Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.	Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
I just can't look at you.	Don't, then.
No.	Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Daddy's very ill.	Oh, well, what, what's he...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.	I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
Do you want some gingerbread?	What?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.	Yeah, well, he's...
Where is she, anyway?	My turn.
You were going without saying goodbye?	I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
What have you been doing since then?	What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Nothing.	Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?	I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.	Is he?
That'll make you happy.	I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?	What?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.	Thanks, Carl...
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...	That's what I mean...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?	No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
No, I wouldn't.	Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.	That's an old maid's tale.
Don't call me "mack," honey.	I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...	Well, she was.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.	Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?	There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.	Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Who are you?	I'm wit' Carlos.
Yo.	Hi.
Remember me, from the pool?	Um. Yeah! Shorty!
So what you think of me?	You look good.
Why don't you ask Eddie?	Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.	I can't man, I'm punished!
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?	C'mon.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.	Eddie from Compost?
The one with the phat ass?	No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?	She lives near Eddie?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.	How old is he?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?	Yeah.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.	Positive.
So what do you want with her anyway?	I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.	Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
I know how ta get him back if you want.	Nah.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?	Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
I wasn't asking.	He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?	You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.	I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.	Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?	Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Thanks for coming down to see us.	Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Greetings, everyone.	Thank God, the police.
So where do you know Alan from?	We play tennis at the club.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.	He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
For sure?	No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
My pleasure.	I'm serious, Sam.
Can I get you something?	Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.	I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.	She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
You should have proved that in a court of law.	My lawyer was a bum.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.	You may be right.
Are you serious?	That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.	This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?	Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.	I'd have been long gone.
And what was that?	How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?	Whoops.
Has he?	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.	Where are you going?
Why are they after you?	Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Sure you did.	Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
That's Brazil.	Yeah. Maybe.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.	Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Alan Stanwyk.	Charmed.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.	Come inside.
I have the same problem with my help.	I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Do you have a passport?	Sure, all drifters do.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.	Take it where?
Will you kill me?	Sure.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'	I wonder if that's his doctor.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.	You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.	Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?	Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.	I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.	It's Scotch-Rumanian.
That's a strange combination.	So were my parents.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?	I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?	Yes.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'	It's amazing.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'	Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...	Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
What is this....	I checked. There was no divorce.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?	Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
No wonder.	I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.	Who are you?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.	She moved out.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.	And a damn fine one, I might add.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.	Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
What's the spread on the game tonight?	I don't know.  Look!
I have some ideas.	Who? Donnie and Marie?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.	You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?	Of course.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!	Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.	Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
That was close...	What did these Vancouver factories do?
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?	I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
You wish.	Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...	Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
You're saying you need money.	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
So what about this watch?	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...	I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?	No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...	Make eye contact when you say that.
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
What an interface!	Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.	Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Got those Vomit invites here...	Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
It's red, Ford.	What?
You okay?	Peachy.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?	I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?	I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Are you okay?	Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.	Ye-ah.  Sure.
Ford, you were right!	Ye-ah.
I'm afraid so, you want her?	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.	ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!	Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.	Did he just say what I think he said?
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.	You need it.
I tried to help you...!	And hey, I appreciate it...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.	Who's my real father, man?
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?	Shut the heck up... Pop.
Like me.	I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'	You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.	Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.	I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
What's fine?	I'm off it!
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.	<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.	Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Well, hello, Ford.	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
What about Don?	Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.	Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.	Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hi, private eye guy!	Hey, the poet...
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.	Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
This isn't music!	It is to us!  It's computerised.
So...	I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?	What?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.	Boca?
Got a wife named Angie.	No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.	You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Well try, okay?	I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Sal --	Yeah?
What's your name, asshole?	Fuck you, Santa Claus!
What?	Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.	Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.	Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.	Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Le sommes nous?	Non!
Sale boulot.	Il fallait le faire.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.	Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Where's he from?	Marseilles.
That's in France.	Yeah, I know.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?	Willie Mays.
Why not?	Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."	Strike out, eh?
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.	The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?	Not a chance.
The greaser with the blonde.	What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.	Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.	Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
What happened to you?	The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?	Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
You want the red or the white?	Pour it in your ear.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.	Just for mistakes of parking?
It was a crematorium.	For garbage?
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.	Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.	I been damn careful up to now.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.	I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
You okay, man?	Elvis has left the building.
You give him his drops?	One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.	He ain't the only one.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.	I'm serious.
Lucky throw, fire boy.	Luck, my ass.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.	I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.	Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
I swear, Satch.	Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.	Uh, huh.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.	Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.	No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Okay, start pedaling.	Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.	Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.	No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
You ready?	Wait...
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?	Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?	Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.	Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What'd you say your name was?	Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...	What?
What the hell...	I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
What's going on?	Nothing...I just spilled something.
That's impossible.	What if it's not...
Dad...?	Johnny...?
How could this be happening?	I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.	Sun spot?
You sound...ground up...?	I'm thirty-five years old.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?	I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
What are you talking about?	I lost you.
What?	I never knew you, Dad.
But that's tomorrow.	Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...	I don't understand.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.	Tell me.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.	I'm glad.
Are you alright"?	Something happened, something...
Whatta you mean...	He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.	I don't know...  What about the other women?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?	They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
What do I tell them?	Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Whatta we do now?	Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?	Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.	What...
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.	Hang on.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.	We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...	What's wrong?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.	What the hell is that smell?
You're not looking too good.	Whoa, I just...I just...
Maybe you outta lay off a little...	Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
She makes ten.	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.	April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Got a minute?	Yeah.  Sure.
He ain't our guy, John.	Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.	Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.	Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
So how'd you like LION KING?	Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	You work too hard, John.
Are you a good cop, John?	I try to be.
Hell-	You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.	Where are you going?
You're all just jealous.	Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?	Cool it, Andy.
Why don't we go take a swim?	I don't know...
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.	Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?	I vote for me.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?	Barely.
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!	Chuck... look.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.	Will you come with me?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.	Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
I don't know.	You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Look what I found.  Remember these?	Did you stay here last night?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?	I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?	I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
What are we gonna do?	Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
This is no time to celebrate!	Just keep your eyes on the road.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.	A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.	No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Darren, we better turn around.	Why?
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.	We're gonna scare him?!
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.	He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!	You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.	This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?	You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
I thought Jason was only a legend?	He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?	We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.	Daddy, what is going on?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...	Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
There...Ya happy?	No.
Why?	'Cause it stinks.
Okay, give it back.	Come and get it.
Where'd you get this?	I found it outside.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.	Are they grown-ups?
So where's Cort gone off to?	Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.	Will you listen, dammit!
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...	There's no time for this bullshit...
Yes!	No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.	But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.	They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.	Skin stretcher was human.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --	-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Steven buggin' you?	Do you have to ask?
That's very colorful, chief.	Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Tell me!	Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Wanna know how I did that?	Yeah...
How many times do you want to hear this?	Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.	The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.	About what?
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?	Never.
That's disgusting.	Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.	Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?	Rennie's not coming.
Where's the radio?	It's...dead.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?	Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
You have no right...	And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
What are you doing??	That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Did you find Rennie?	She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.	He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I...I can't...	You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
Why are you doing this to yourself?	I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.	I don't know what to say...
So, are you having fun yet?	Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.	There's something I haven't told you...
Yes...	The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.	I want to go home. I want off this ship.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...	What do you mean???
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...	Where are they?
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.	I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.	Very big.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.	You are going where?
Crosstown.	Very bad today.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.	That's where I peed.
Guys ready to order?	Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.	Shut up, Elliot.
But didn't we know it would happen?	Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
It's just a review.	It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What happened eighteen months ago?	Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.	Where is it?
How do you Eknow.	Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?	About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Had to be him.	She was very evasive.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.	What are you talking about?
This could be it.	This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.	Our Peter?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?	The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?	I go to college. I thought you knew.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?	That's completely crazy.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'	And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.	I have a class. I'm late.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.	First you tell me.
See, Daddy.	And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.	We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
And you've been extremely patient.	You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.	That's very lovely actually.
Alma Wetzel.	Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
This could be it!	This could be it!
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.	It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
We must have been heroic.	Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.	They're only gonna lose.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?	The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.	Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.	My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?	I can't find it.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.	Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
What do you want me to do?	Show him who we are.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.	The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
A grandmother. God bless you.	He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
You're a family man, Frankie?	Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?	I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.	Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.	I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
They're my team.	No. They're not your team. They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?	You're out of bullets.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.	Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
What do you mean?	To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
And he has finer moments now and then.	He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.	The fact is, I have to get going.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.	And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.	They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."	Are you sure?
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."	"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?	Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.	I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
You're a clergyman.	Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.	I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.	No, no -- just a moment, please.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.	I thought you were against fighting.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...	The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!	Panditji -- please, help me.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.	I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?	Hm.  Is it?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.	I --
Who is that young man?	That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.	I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.
They're sparing no one, I see.	No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?	My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.	Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Perhaps some tea?	I dined at the prison.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?	Very well.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?	He's "discovering" India.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.	Have you found him?
You almost sound like you believe that.	Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
There are a few million miles to go yet.	It's over.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.	I like football.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.	Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.	A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.	It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?	Luca could still be an accomplice.
Surely you know what you have.	We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
We believe we have a suspect.	What a relief.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?	Thank you, no.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.	No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Suit yourself.	Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.	Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
Again?	She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Everybody goes there.	You may as well invite her here.
I have your samples ready.	Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Anything I've forgotten?	We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.	Antonio, the choir...
Vincent...Vincent...	German, is that you?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--	How do I square the accident?
Yeah.	I'd have to bleach my hair.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.	You worried about the cost?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.	No.
So you didn't do it after all.	I guess somebody beat me to it.
What happened?	You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?	That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
I've got enough here.	Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.	Not like <i>this</i> one.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.	I get my own help.
What about them?	They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.	They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.	I bet.
You okay?	I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Feel good?	Yeah.
What's Beynon got set up?	Small town, small bank, big money.
Just like old times?	Better than old times.
Where did you get them developed?	Assumed name... Houston.
Half a million.	That Beynon's got a long arm.
You been okay?	Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
That's not all of it.	No. It's been a long time.
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.
It's just been a while.	We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.	If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.	At least you were outside.
I mean it.	I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.	We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
They checked in.	Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.	I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
Do you trust him?	I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.	If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Yeah.	You sent me to him.
He must have.	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
You've got it all figured.	No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
There may be a hunting party.	Why, there's nothing on the news?
What?	If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
You can't trust anything these days.	I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Okay?	I think so... I don't know.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.	Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Things can't get much worse can they?	I don't see how.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.	Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
What now?	We walk.
Where's home?	Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?	Tell her you robbed a bank...
Gonna knock down a wall?	Might try that.
Two.	What about the vault?
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?	Aren't we going a little hard?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.	He took the day off.
Where we go in1?	Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.
Let's just get to the border.	Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Don't you want to go to the airport?	Not now.
You do what he says, Harold.	After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
A couple of weeks back.	How?
What do you want?	What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?	This is my brother's car.
Well, he drove it into the river.	Was the steering faulty?
I made a mistake.	What?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.	That's nice.
Everyhing go off all right?	Fine...  I want to talk to you.
She's nothing to do with me.	What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?	Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Really.	I must go. I'm in a hurry.
How were things between you and Frank?	He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?	Nicer than most.
I call that regular.	He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?	Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?	It's the truth.
Do you?	Yes, I do.
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.
How'd you know where I'd be?	You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?	He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
That's why you waited for me.	Not entirely. No.
Then he must have pulled her.	Expect so.
Oh, what you doing now?	Working at Woolworths.
You all right now?	Yeah.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.	Thanks.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.	What?
It just would. He was always the same.	Since when did he drink whisky?
See you later.	Where you off to?
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
I'm staying with a friend.	Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Will this do?	Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.	That little shit!
What about Keith?	What about Keith?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.	Making a living.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.	Not till I'm dead, Eric.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.	Sod off.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.	Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!	No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Not suede boots!	Knock it off, Gerald.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?	Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
Four hundred?	That's right.
I'll see you, then.	Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.	I had to.
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...	What?
We're stuck with this...	We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...	It's too...
It is.	Eh?
You're on this...	All of, they got you on this "board..."
And it's not right to the customers.	I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?	Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...that's right...	Eh?
For some sales pro...	...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Who?	You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"	Nurses.
The nurses?	Yes.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.	Himself?
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?	What?
How many leads have we got?	The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.	Yes.
We're just "talking" about it.	We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
No.	As a robbery.
You didn't?	No.  Not actually.
Is that what I said?	What did he say?
A job with Graff.	Is that what I said?
Oh, yes, George.	What does that mean?
Are you sure?	Yes.  I'm sure.
...you don't have to come in...	...and rob the place...
Why?	Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...	Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...	I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...	What?  You can't do any what?
Yes.	Huh?
Clear...	Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.	That's...
I am?	You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He said he filed...	He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
The cops?	Yes.  The cops.  No.
Why don't you think so?	Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Yes.	I was at home, where were you?
Thieves.	Why?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?	Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Who used to say that?	In school.
Who told you...?	Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...	I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
The people downtown said...	You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?	Could I...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...	Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Would you come in here, please?	And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...	...you didn't close...
John.  John...	Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
I'm not sure I have two.	I saw the board.  You've got four...
Can't do it.	I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Why?	Because I say so.
What happened?	Somebody broke in.
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.	It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.	What does that fucking mean?
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?	It's not impossible.
Yes.  I hear you.	You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
Why I don't...	You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
You robbed the office.	Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.	I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
What?	You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
Don't.	I'm sorry.
Why?	Because I don't like you.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...	Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
Shelly...!	Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
They took the leads?	Mmm.
Fuck you care...?	"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
How was it...?	From the store.
You closed 'em today?	Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.	He's right, Williamson.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?	Yes.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?	Sure.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!	Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
What?	Kenilworth...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?	Me.
Yeah.	Mm.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?	Did I...?
Monday.	She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Who did she call?	I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
When did you write the check?	Yest...
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.	It's not me, it's my wife.
I told you.	You tell me again.
No.  She told me "right now."	We'll speak to her, Jim...
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.	She told me I have to.
No, Jim.	I do.  If I don't get my money back...
What...?	I...
What?	And the check is...
Fuckin' asshole.	What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You hear what I said?	Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.	You did that?
You just this morning...	Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
We haven't got a lead...	Why not?
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.	They didn't get my contracts.
They got, listen to me...	The...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...	The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Why do you have to go?	To do business.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.	I'm not hungry.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.	The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What took so long?	She couldn't decide.
Bought at the airport.	This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.	Connie.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.	Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.	You're not my father!
Then why do you come to me?	Because I need MONEY!
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.	I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Goddamn bitch.	Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
What's 'cent' Anne?'	A hundred years...it's a toast.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?	It's not talk; I'm doing it.
He is weak.	He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.	He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.	 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.	Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.	We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.	Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.	Mio fratello.
Oh, 'scuse me.	It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Count on me; that's my specialty.	I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?	You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.	No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.	 And he agreed?
That's off now.	I'm going to see my parents.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.	You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.
Will you tell him?	I don't know.
Goddamn it, where were you?	I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.	I can't let him down.
Me too, Tom?	Yeah, give me a minute.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.	But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.	But if you're wrong...
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.	My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!	It was a boy.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?	Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.	His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.	That plane goes to Miami...
I want it met.	Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.	Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
It might show.	Mike wants it.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.	Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.	The room has a bug in it.
You're right.	Tom, what do I do now?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.	Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.	Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
...and the tape will be running.	Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
What the hell are you talking about?	We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?	Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?	He is, I believe, a brother.
Senator Kane.	This meeting is adjourned.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.	This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.	Michael.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.	Get out of my hotel.
No, I meant lose his family.	Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.	It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Enjoy.	I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.	We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.	The money was sent.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.	I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?	No, I'm fine.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.	So?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.	Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?	That is a complete falsehood.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.	I do not.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.	We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
I know.	Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?	I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
On the phone?	No, she's here.
He don't want to talk?	We worked it all out beforehand.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.	You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
Don't I look like I'm listening?	We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
What if I say shove it?	Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
You want a war?	We got no choice.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.	Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.	What was that?
Thanks, doll.	I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
What makes you say that?	Just thinking out loud.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.	All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
This looks corny.	Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.	Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.	What's to be jealous of?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.	All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.	I'm not a kid.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?	Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.	I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What're you talking about?	What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.	Expect nothing fancy.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.	Tea is fine.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?	No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.	Your wife?
Then you're as single as I am.	No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.	No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.	There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?	What do I do?
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.	But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?	Just that I was in the Marines.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?	You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?	In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?	I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.	What's to sketch?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.	But why?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.	You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.	Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
"Bride of Frankenstein."	Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.	Your family ate dripping?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.	I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
No.	Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.	Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
I never thought you were.	You don't think of me that way, do you?
Ah.  A philosopher.	Thoreau with a lawnmower.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.	What happened?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.	You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?	I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?	There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?	You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.	You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Good afternoon, Clayton.	Do I look okay?
No.  The girl.	Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Is that --?	The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.	A very lucky thing indeed.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.	That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."	I don't remember that one.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?	There are straps in back.
Just take off the fucking mask!	Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?	I haven't done a damn thing with you!
You okay?	Oh Clayton.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.	You only embarrass yourself.
I didn't ask George to invite you.	Then who did?
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.	But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.	You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.	Oh dear.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?	Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Which ones?  I bring them all.	Luminal.
She is horrible.	She is beautiful.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.	I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...	It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."	Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?	Sure.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?	Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.	But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.	No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.	Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?	Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
What are you doing here?	Is there someplace we can talk?
It's been a long time, Memphis --	Six years ...
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...	Tell me about Kip -
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce	No, but you dress like an asshole ...
I think about that night a lot...	Me, too. Every time I walk...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...	Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
Get out of here, Ray --	One more night --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...	How is he?
You have my word...	Get out of here, then. Now.
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...	No...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?	Kip.
I know you.	You know my back.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?	Something like that -
What's this -- ?	Cadillac.
You seem a little hinked-up ...	Not at all ...
Got it ...	Good.
You mean the poor --	No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Lookit Kip. All grown up...	Hey, Donny --
Forget that ...	Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."	And there she is --
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...	There's no one left ...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --	He didn't mess up. There it is ...
You look good...	You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?	How's Kip?
Why didn't you tell me?	I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...	You remember that, Kip?
Breakfast brunch -- ?	Yes, sir -
Any more, O -- ?	You guys are through...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...	Damn crooks is everywhere --
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...	Just hold on... Hold on ...
I heard you were pumping gas -	Something like that -
Nah. It's a scratch.	Okay --
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -	Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
What happened to you?	What?
You?	Me.
You?	Me...
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean	I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Having fun, Kip?	Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Too early to tell. Nervous?	Nah.
What are you doing here?	I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Where'd you find this one?	Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You boost her -- ?	Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
What are we gonna do -- ?	Hospital.
Call 911 -	Call 'em here -- ?
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --	What are you doing here?
Buy you a drink?	Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
On account of Mitch?	On account of me.
I do ... I cut "em...	Cut 'em...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...	I bet you say that to all the girls...
Let me worry about The Club ...	No worries ...
This time it's for real?	Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Some crew you got ...	If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
You need him...	No we don't -
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.	Who's "Eleanor?"
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.	So what's in there -- ?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?	Not really --
But he was always a bad kid, that one.	No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.	Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.	Oh I Him.
I don't want any more of that Shit.	Wha?  Me?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.	Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.	The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.	I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.	I got scared.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.	Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Give'm a drink.	I gotta talk to you.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.	Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :	I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
I gotta go home.	What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.	There's a shovel at my mother's.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.	Will you get the fuck out of here.
I hate to do dishes.	Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...	It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?	He's okay. They sobered him up.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.	I don't want them left back.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.	But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.	But, Paulie, please.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.	Oh shit.
Who's she talking to?	That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.	Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.	What are we gonna do up there?
She didn't do it again did she?	Jesus Christ. Not even close.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.	Why not?
How's the woman?	Gone.
What?	She went to Medical school in California.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?	Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Why didn't you yoke him?	Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Okay.	So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Hi.	How you doin'?
--That isn't funny--	--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
WILL!	And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Yah, that is a nice ass.	You could put a pool in that backyard.
Holy shit.	So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
What'd you say about me?	Shut the fuck up.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.	You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.	Retainer...
What class did you say that was?	History.
How'd you like that course?	Good, it was all right.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.	Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--	Which one's your building?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.	Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.	Hey fuck you.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.	Fuck do you want?
--That edge!	An integer.
I told you to cooperate with these people.	C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Get out, Will.	Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--	I'm pretty sure it's right.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.	Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Yes.	Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?	Yeah, cured polio.
Hello.	The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I didn't see you at the reunion.	I've been busy.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--	I got your card.
Why me?	I need someone with your kind of background.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?	Five.
Jobs doing what?	Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
--And confuse him--	--Gerry--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--	Hold on!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--	--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
He won't be a failure!	If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!	He's not you!
So I hear you're taking some time.	Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Do you know when you'll be back?	I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
About thirty million to one.	You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?	Had one, now I'm fucked again.
You're right. I know.	Will, your not getting off that easy.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"	If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
Yeah, I read those.	What did you think?
That must have taken you a long time.	Yeah, it did take me a long time.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.	How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.	You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Yeah. Do you paint?	No.
Crayons?	This is a real piece of shit.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?	You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.	I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.	No, I don't.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?	I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?	Yeah.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?	Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.	Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Do you think you're alone?	What?
Do you have a soul-mate?	Define that.
They're all dead.	Not to me, they're not.
Don't give me you line of shit.	I didn't want the job.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?	I didn't ask for this.
The wrench, why?	Cause fuck him, that's why.
Oh, I know.	It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.	It's not your fault.
That's what you want?	Yeah, I think so.
I just want you to know, Sean...	You're Welcome, Will.
No. Thank you.	Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
You suck.	What?
Sounds good, where are you now?	You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...	I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.	Okay...
No I haven't...	Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Yeah.	Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?	You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.	How the hell did you do that?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.	I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Come with me to California.	What?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.	I'm not honest?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!	You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
You doin' the hirin'?	Well, I'm contracting the land.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.	You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Will ya look at her!	I never knowed they was anything like her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--	Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?	We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.	I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
Lots must a died, too.	Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Maybe the road's out.	I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.	Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
I didn't see nothin'.	Okay. Go on.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.	Why, you're the preacher!
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.	Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Excuse me for asking.	I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
And you ain't ashamed?	He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.	I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.	That's our place.
They're all gone--or dead.	They never wrote you nothing?
Think she'll hold?	If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?	You're right!
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?	Thought you was in jail.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?	I aim to.
But we can still do it, honey.	I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.	Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.	But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
How about a lift, mister?	Can't you see that sticker?
Been doin' a job?	Yeah.
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.	Naw--not much!
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.	If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.	Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Yes, ma'am.	Didn' you have no breakfast?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.	Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.	Ain't a-goin', thas all...
How long you plan to be in Arizona?	No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?	Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!	Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Jus' sassy, that's all.	Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.	Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.	It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.	I'd a found you, Ma.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.	Don't taste bad.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.	Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.	You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.	They killed Casy first.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.	They know what--this fella looks like?
What is it?	Don't know--but it's better'n this.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.	Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--	Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...	Then what, Tom?
Which ones?	There, them stripy ones.
Tommy?	Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.	Are you crazy?
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?	That's what I asked you, ain't it?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.	But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!	Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
You mean get off my own land?	Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
How you get all this money?	Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!	Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Morning.	Morning.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.	Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.	I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
What do you do?	I sell biscuits to the Southland.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.	I'm Martin Blank.
So, what are you doing now?	Whatever I can get away with.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?	Fine, Bob. How are you?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.	A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.	Insane.
So you eat-- read it everyday?	Yes.
What's your business?	I'm a professional killer.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?	You see someone?
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.	Bad experiences.
You're fucking psycho.	Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--	We haven't seen each other since high school.
He was trying to kill you, right!	Yes.
Not the other way around...?	No.
I was leaving.	That's probably a good idea.
You went to school with these people.	Come on.
Like a union?	Like a club. Work less, make more.
Is that right?	Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?	Hello Martin. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.	That sounds pretty interesting...
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.	Yup.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.	All of it?
This is not good.	I'll do it tomorrow.
I bought a new rug.	That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?	It's a place where religious people--
So what happened to you?	Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
God it's great to see you.	You too.
I have to get my head back into my work.	Work's good for the soul.
This is Annie MacLean.	Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --	Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --	Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.	Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.	Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.	All by yourself?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --	Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.	You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.	Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
What?	You ever just stand still for a minute?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.	Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
I thought you lived in Chicago?	I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?	Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Shit.	Need a lift?
Thanks.	Feel good?
Yeah.	You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
How long did you live here with your wife?	Five years. My son was born here.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.	I won't ask you to.
Show me again.	Annie!
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --	I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.	I brought it to you in the hospital.
Yeah?	Maybe they should put me down too.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?	Whatever you want.
Oh. You didn't tell me.	I didn't know I had to.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?	What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!	Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.	Don't they believe in signs here?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."	There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Did he mention it?	Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.	You're right. Good.
Well...  So you tried riding again?	Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --	... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --	Tom?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!	NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.	Well, now you know what it feels like.
Who's going to want me now?	What?... Oh baby...
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?	Tom's gone.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.
How's everything?	Good.
It's me.	Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.
Okay. We'll see you later then.	Yeah. Bye.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.	We're very lucky.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...	Sing it to me, Frankie!
Aw... that's so sweet.	I love you.
How was the dinner?	All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?	Yeah.
What did he say?	No.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?	I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
And you think it's best if I don't come.	No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.	Okay.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.	You're allergic to hay.
How are you feeling about work?	Let's not talk about that now.
Was the trip okay?	Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.	Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?	Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...	She calls him Tommy...
Thank you. You're all doing too much.	Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.	I'd love to go there one time...
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?	I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Sounds like something Tom would say.	Yes, it does.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.	Promise?
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...	Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
- See, what you can do for him --...	Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.	That's what some folks say.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...	And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Isn't it like, obvious?	Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?	We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Sure?	Sure.
Grace, I need you to come with me.	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.	No!
It's warmer than I thought.	You want to go to a movie tonight?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!	I just could never say it!
Jude, you okay?	I'm okay... I'm okay.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!	OK, OK.
You want to watch some television?	Maybe... look -- just...
What, sweetheart?	I want to see Pilgrim.
Did you notice -- no cane?	I know. Amazing.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?	I did. He said he had work to do until late.
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Long enough.	You ever miss it?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.	Honey... I was always good.
You think it's cool?	It's cool!
How's it going, Ray?	It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.	Alright sir.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...	...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Shit!	Shh!
What?	Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?	Again?  Yeah sure.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!	Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!	That's far out!
Damn!	A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.	Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Yeah?	Go fix the phones.
And what's he do?	That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.	Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.	That's bullshit.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!	Burn!
What the hell are you doing?	It's cool, I'm just looking.
It has a killer refresh rate.	P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Make it our first date.	You're not gonna win.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.	The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.	Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
What?	This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Shit!!	It's my subway defense system.
I can't believe they decided you won.	They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...	Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?	No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
You're welcome.	What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
There's a new virus in the database.	What's happening?
What? whatwhatwhat?	One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Any questions?	Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.	Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
A hacker planted the virus.	Virus?
I don't want to go to jail for this.	Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
I'll take you down there.	All right.
So?	So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.	No, you don't understand.
Brady!	Get back!
Brady!	No. You son of a bitch!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.	Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.	It's okay..it's okay.
Found it.	Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Why not?	Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
Because the lights are all out.	I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
Yes.	I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Night Doc.	Drive Carefully.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?	Got it Earl.
It's been eleven months.	Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?	You bet.
Had enough?	No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Jamie!	Oh Rachel!
Rachel!	I've got you come on, go down.
We'll hear sirens soon.	Then we'll be safe?
Why don't you go make some coffee.	All right.
Hi Rachel.	Hi.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.	Don't you mean what you do best?
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?	Jamie?
132 to 133 this is 134.	This is 132, over.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.	He's here, Sheriff.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.	Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
When he makes that call.	All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Is that him? Is that him?	Yes.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.	Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.	You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
How's it powered?	Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Loomis. Haddonfield.	Car trouble?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!	What's going on?
What?	What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.	You blame everything on kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.	Huh?
Hello?	Why did you hang up on me?
Sure, see you later.	Bye.
Probably Mister Riddle.	He was watching me.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.	Annie!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.	No, he's not.
You idiot!	...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.	Lee Brackett.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...	Could have...
A man wouldn't do that...	He isn't a man.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...	If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Sure...	Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
They could be.	I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...	I found the car! He's here!
Is Annie around?	No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?	Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?	Sure. Sure.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."	I don't like that story.
Not any more.	Why are they under there?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.	There was no one outside.
Who is it?	Tommy, let me in!
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!	I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!	It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?	Let's make more popcorn.
Hello.	Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...	I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
There's nothing else I can do.	You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.	He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.	What did you use before?
Thorazin.	He'll barely be able to sit up.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.	I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
I see.	What does that mean?
Pull up to the entrance!	Shouldn't we pick him up?
...any sister talk?	Mm-mm!
What are your favorite buildings, David?	You want to see some?
Yeah.	A lot of works.
Uh, who gets dropped first?	Uh --
We're a big hit.	Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh!	Oh, is that what it is?
Oh, geez, yeah.	Okay.
Uh...	It depends on what way you want to go.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.	Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
What?	Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.	Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?	Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
I can't resist.	Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.	We're actresses.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...	I cry at the opera.
Oh, what, what do you do?	I'm an architect.
Yeah.	What time do you get off?
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.	Uh-huh.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...	Yes.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...	Well...
We could...we could do that.	Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--	You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?	Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.	Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.	'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Hi.	What are you doing here?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.	Ohhhh!
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.	Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.	Well, sure.
How's everything?	Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Elliot!	I have been in love with you for so long.
I was looking for you.	I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.	What do you expect me to say?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.	If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
And you're in love overnight?	I care a great deal about him, yes.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.	I know!  I know!
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?	But, you got four children!
Are you?	No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?	Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.	Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?	Leave me alone, can you?!
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.	You're not lost.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...	Yeah.
Don't make it worse, Dad.	Always.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.	It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, Mom!	Oh, honey!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.	How can we be happy?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.	But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.	Mom, come out!
Isn't it enough that I can love you?	Mmm...
...or films you must see or... 	Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I don't sell my work by the yard!	Oh, Frederick!
You know, you've been very nervous lately.	I can't take this anymore.
Oh, Jesus!	Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
N-n-no, not that.	Hello?
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 	Like what?!  What?
But you don't have any symptoms!	You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.	Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...	No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
You're just realizing this now?	Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?	I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.	Okay.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--	How are you?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...	Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!	Oh, now-- 
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.	I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...	Huh?
How is everything?	Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!	Wow!
Gee.	Is there no chance?
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--	Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?	I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.	Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Hey!	...from Mavis, also.
Okay, okay.	Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.	Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
What?  You're kidding!	No, no, we decided!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?	Oh, sure.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.	Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.	I should get a garter belt.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!	Oh, your kids are so adorable.
You found all this, all this out on one date?	Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Yeah, can you believe it?	Really?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...	Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?	Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.	What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Oh, gosh.	You got it.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?	Yeah, that's clerical.
You treat me like a loser.	How?
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--	Uh, losers!  All losers!
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.	You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Well, why don't you share them with us?	I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.	I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Can we, can we go?	No!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!	Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
I'd never do that.	...in a really horrible way.
People change...you know.	Well, I hope you've changed.
Are you, are you out of work or something?	No, well...I've been trying to write.
Nobody ever said it.	Really?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?	Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
No, the reason I ask is--	You've always hated my taste in the past.
No, I haven't.	You have.
Oh, I'm fine.	What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.	Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Oh!	Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
Oh, wow!	It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...	I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.	Oh, yeah?  What?
When'd you get here?	Just a few minutes ago.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.	Hmm.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?	Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
I can't think.	...you don't have to think.
A reward...	I'm going to tell you later....
Well.  Word gets around.	...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.	Or, perhaps...
What have they got you doing?	Orderly.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.	I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Yes?	And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Why me?	Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?	Now, whyn't you help us?
That would adversely impact my income.	Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
We could skip the Gavotte.	Say it in English.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 	<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?	You want me to be?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?	...they did it for a lark.
You're ready now.	I'm not.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 	...the whole world's out to get you...
First things first.	You take this much time over everything?
Where was the call from.	Somewhere in Italy.
...and then, he'll be coming down.	You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Yes, I did.	I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...	Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Look at this:	You seen John Brigham...?
No. 	Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I am all attention.	He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...	And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 	You nervous...?
Waal...	'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Give it up, Evelda.	Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up.	Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?	And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Of course, Commendatore...	Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 	I'll have them picked up.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.	Enchante.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.	Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Who does not?	If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
I require...	...yes, yes, yes...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?	No. 
Yes.... yes...	...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....	Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You were given backup....	THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
No, I don't get you...	Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...	I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?	Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.	Spoken like a Protestant.
...I'm sorry....?	...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
...which of us is free...?	Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
Look what they put her on...	No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?	...not to turn around.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.	You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.	You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Fine, thank you, but	Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
I am on the track of...	Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Ask me when we get home.	Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Hello....?	...what did you want? 
I know where he is.	I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 	What shape is the scar?
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....	No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.	I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...	....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
Tell me why...?	I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.	...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...	No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Yes.	How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.	Yes.
You want some <u>advice</u>.	Yes.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...	No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.	And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...	About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?	Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You think you're so...but you're just...	That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.	Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.	Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
No.	That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.	Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
Howdy Pouty.	I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...	Oh thanks, it was nothing...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...	Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.	Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...	Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...	Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...	Yes you do.
Yeah. I guess I do.	Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...	Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.

Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.	What do you want me to say?

What's in that cup?
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.	Hey really, I don't feel so great.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.	Like last night, Veronica?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......	Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....	I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?	Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.	Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.	We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
You stupid cunt!	You goddamn bitch!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!	Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.	King David.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?	I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Where did you get these?	Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
What do you want from me?	Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!	Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.	Is she dead?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?	Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?	Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.	Give me the clipboard.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.	Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.	Uh-huh.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?	Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.	Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.	S'okay....
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."	Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.	Yeah. Scary stuff.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.	My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Do you take German?	French.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.	Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
We killed them, didn't we?	Of course.
Your son's dead and you love him.	How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.	She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.	Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...	Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.	You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
You know what I want, babe?	What?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.	I thought I...you..
Answer him dick!	Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...	Shut the fuck up, all right.
You two....	Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Turn that back on!	This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.	That's three things.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.	Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?	playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on! Sausage rolls.	Come on through.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.	breaks down into heavy sobs.
He's the manager!	leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.	I just want to be on my own for a while.
My name is Gina!	It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!	Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.	gives her a sympathetic look.
Mummy!	Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .	Somebody's got to help us!
To be known as He!	He . . .
Him.	Him . . .
I shall call him Diello.	You're such an incredible woman.
I think I'm going crazy.	No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.	That was what we were led to believe . . .
But that's not true! I've got one.	I need my sodding parents' consent.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?	You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.	Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.	Second most common?
Skin cancer.	Eighty third most common.
No.	Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?	Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
I have my connections	Really? Do tell.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.	I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Who's Allison?	Allison Dormere. Your intern.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.	What's the difference?
You could say that.	Zero's a number right?
Oh my God. It's coming out.	What?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.	In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.	Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?	What?
Kirsty... Kirsty?	It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.	I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Morgue...?	That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.	A little? Try unbelievably.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!	Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.	I don't work here.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?	Wow you are out of it.  
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.	Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.	Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Wait... what the hell is this...	Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?	YOU!
You okay?	I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!	I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.	They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.	LaPlante!
The bathroom!  For two days?	Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?	Right.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .	It was you!  I thought I heard...
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.	Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...	I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?	So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.	You mean John Bubber?
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?	Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
We're all assholes, Bernie?	When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
Bernie, how'sa kid?	You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Bill, I...	DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
Bill, I got financial problems and...	I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
He waited for you three hours!	You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...	Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...	What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?	Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...	A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Underbelly!	In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I snuck in.	You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?	Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
You never saw that picture, huh?	What picture?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?	I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Uh, er... I...	You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...	It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.	Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
You were... very... inspiring.	A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
It's not right, Gale...	It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
"A little mistake"!	No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...	You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
What's the matter?	This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"	Unprofessional.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.	Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?	She's talking to him now.
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!	I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
You didn't... get it on with him?	Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?	Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.	How are they with kids?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?	Okay.
Give it here, Bernard.	Whoa, check it out.
Where are these toys of yours?	A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.	Right.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?	Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.	Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.	I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
As long as you keep remembering why.	Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --	No, no, no, no.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.	Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Well, can I make an appointment?	Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Do you do washing machines, too?	Just show me the way.
So, you're just kind of a roving --	-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Do you have a family?	Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
You must value your independence.	Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.	Uh huh.
I found a cent!	"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.	Did Daddy tease you?
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!	Holly -- that's not so.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.	Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!	Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
Have you just plain asked him?	I've asked him what's wrong.
C'mon, kids, let's go.	"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?	Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Thank God.	I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Whew.	The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Honey --	Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.	Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --	High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
We're going to think about it.	It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
How long does it have to be a new house?	One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.	Oh, honey.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!	There might be some extras in the garage.
Oh God.	Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Just reduced.	Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
It's fun.	Grow up, Dreyer.
Are we gonna buy this house?	Do you have enough money?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?	No.
Neil, do you mind?	Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.	And I can't help having a cold.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.	Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Do you see a man?	No.
Really?	Really.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.	Talk to me about what?
What do you think?	They appear to be authentic.
Tough.	It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
He had to come from somewhere.	I think it was England.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.	So?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?	No.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.	That is what bothers me.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.	And what do you think you will find in another land?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
Then take me with you.	Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.	Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?	He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.	You got me.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?	Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.	Jennifer.
I'm just trying to place you.	I've lived all over the world.
You're not an easy person to get to know.	Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?	I wanted to get to know you better.
That makes you uncomfortable?	A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.	Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.	I don't think it is a duplication.
You stayed here again last night?	I was working on the cataloging.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.	We'll see.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.	This cannot be.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.	I'll no forget you.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?	Fine.
Talley.	It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?	It was stolen.
Who sent you?	Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!	You won't die if you let me help.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.	Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?	That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.	That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Then we might as well die rich.	I'm not going to die for this!
You with the cops?	The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.	How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --	You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.	Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
You got something to say?	I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.	Give me an ETA.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.	What hospital?
What do you want?	My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.	You said they would be here!
Can we talk some more when you get here?	We'll see you in a couple of hours.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.	But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.	You sure?
We can't carry him.	You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
What do you want?	We can't make the microwave work.
Kevin left without you.	I don't know what you're talking about.
Smith!  Wake up!	What are you doing?!  Stop that!
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?	Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
Where are they?	York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's wrong with the radio?	Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
He says that his father's hurt.	If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --	Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.	Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.	Are all of you named Jones?
What's my name?	What?
The kids are in here!	Where's the office?
Can you open them?	I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.	How do I reach him?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?	You can let go.
Marlon and Al....	We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?	These disks . . . where are they?
I guess we each have something the other wants.	I guess we do.
What happened?	They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Ten.	And four children?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.	I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?	Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Have you requested re-enforcements?	Yes we have.
Excuse me, Colonel.	We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I don't understand.	Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.	Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.	It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.	Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites.	Satellites?
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?	The front gate would be best, General.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.	You said you had no whiskey.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?	No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
You know what the Scottish call it?	No.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?	No, sir.
We are better here.	Listen, you need me.
I led no massacres.	You think they will believe you?
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.	At least.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?	I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Let's go.	Take the river road back. It is clear.
Satellite feed.	Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?
Let’s go, Jock.	Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Get out of this room and get back to work.	I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.	Please, except my humblest apologies...
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.	I would never do that.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.	I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.	That will take time.
Who did you call?	Call, sir?
What do you want?	We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
The commander is not here.	He will be here.
How much?	One thousand francs.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.	How do you know?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.	I will give you my house.
This time the Militia will kill us.	They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?	I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
They do not have your connections.	Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?	Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Has Roger spoken yet?	No, Odette says he's in shock.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
I will not leave without the twins.	We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.	I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.	Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Rutaganda's place?	What's wrong?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.	Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.	Thank you, sir.
I don't know.	Go downstairs, I will help you.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.	If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.	I'm confused.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --	-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- bullshit --	-- the whole thing is falling apart!
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?	But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
And how the hell are we going to do that?	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.	Not at all!
Oh, for chrissake --	-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
More the merrier.	No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Melissa!	Ms. Marr!
Oh, really: who?	Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.	As a tumor.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.	I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
'Less the place really is haunted.	Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
What's in there?	Nothing.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."	Did it work?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?	What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!	It's not going to let us out!
Pritchett, is that you?	Up here --
Pritchett!	Over here!
I'll meet you down there.	Take the gun.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.	Best of a nightmare.
Is she...alright?	I thought she was dead. For sure.
Why not?	Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
You hear somebody?	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
I was upstairs with Eddie --	-- that's the fact, bud --
Good point.	Let's try down here...
Price!!	He's gotta still be down here.
It's okay, everything's okay now.	He's dead...?
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!	For chrissake give me a hand!
What?	Jesus!
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.	Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
Then what the hell are we doing here?	How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?	Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --	-- I pose you the same question --
-- what...are...you...going...to --	-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.	What?
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
I'm ready now.	Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --	-- my loss --
I think...I may have the answer.	What?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.	Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Vannacutt!!	Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.	Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I'll take my chances.	Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Please! I need your help.	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
It works.	Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Wish I could take the credit, but --	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
And you think it's in there?	Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
Pritchett: what is going on?	He must've unsealed the room!
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.	What was her name?
Town records are coming up now.	What will they tell you?
It will heal.	I'm sorry.
What do these ingredients mean?	Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Well then who did?!	Maybe it was Colleen...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!	Ok...
H-how long will it take?	Go to your room!  Now!
What's he doing daddy?	He's blessing the house.
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.	Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.	Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
It's just going to take a while.	Whatever you say.
To our family.	To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What the hell is that?	I don't know.  That's strange.
Who?	I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.	Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
It just disappeared.  Literally.	I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
You don't think I know?	Know what?
Are you all right?	I'm ok.
You're bleeding.	I'm all right...
What do you mean, unfortunately?	We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.	You'll have to settle for turkey.
You must be a Londrigan.	Yes, I am.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.	Aubrey?  It's mommy.
What was she afraid of?	Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.	We'll be there.
Where did you find this?	It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Do you mind if I borrow it?	Not at all, if it can help.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.	Jesus Christ ...
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.	Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?	You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?	Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Something bad.	And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Wha .... ?	The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!	Where?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.	Right.
How have you ... ?	Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?	No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
But I don't know what's going on.	Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.	Would you know this store again?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.	No.  We want ...
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.	On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
JP?	Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...	I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.	Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Really?	Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.	Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.	Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...	Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.	Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.	But I said I was sorry....
Alex, are you....	I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
My life is not some deal.  I...	It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!	Ooh-kay...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?	Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....	As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.	Yeah.  The big E.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--	Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.	Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.	Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Way to go, Anna.	When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.	That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.	Like a "cat", one could say.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!	Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.	We're here to say, your government was right.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?	You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!	You want an address on that last one?
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...	How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?	Yes.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.	For God's sake, chain this convict.
Get away from there, convict!	Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?	It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?	You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....	And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Don't be stupid...they...	Bastard!  If you were a true American.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."	Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?	I'm supposed to fall for that?
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...	They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Something short.	Sharp.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!	What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
That smart?!	But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?	Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.	I'm happy enough.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!	He didn't offer you money.
A sawbuck!	Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!	You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Hungry, anyway.	I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.	Oh, no, really, I --
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?	Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.	Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, she probably had a deadline...	Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Smitty.	Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
...Certain people are --	Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
...Huh?	You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
What a beautiful thought.	What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.	Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Oh, Norville --	Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --	Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --	Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --	Now, Aim --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!	Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.	Phony, huh?
Muncie.	Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
You can't print that!	He grins wolfishly.
Terrific.	So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --	I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --	But, buddy, you were --
Awwww, buddy --	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --	Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
...You don't?	Nah, that's all forgotten.
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?	Norville.
Geez, I --	Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.	Well, why don't ya read it.
...Yeah, go ahead.	'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --	Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
...education, were you?	Well, I'm a college graduate --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!	Oh my God, sir!
Finally.	-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
...adenoids.	No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.
Good morning, miss.	Thank you for waking me.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.	I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.	Ti-Misery?  What's that?
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.	But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I'd love to.	Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.	That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Does she suffer?	I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
She can never be cured?	I've never heard of a cure.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.	Thank you.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.	I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.	Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
The West Indies?	A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
But it's so far away...	That's rather nice, isn't it?
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.	Thank you.  But who sits there? 
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?	Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?	I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?	Of course, Wes.
It is not beautiful.	You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Have the servants made you comfortable?	Yes, thank you.
A figure of St. Sebastian.	Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.	If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?	Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?	Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Wesley can be very entertaining.	Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.	I love Fort Holland.
I told you.	Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.	But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
I don't know -- I don't know--	It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.	Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
What about her?	In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?	Got a meeting uptown.
Benjie!	Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --	And as usual no one believed me...
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.	That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.	You want to go?
What do you think?	Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?	Hmm. Good night.
I... I think I am...	You know Elena, I've been thinking--
If you're going to insult me --	What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.	Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Elena.	Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?	Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
I'm fine dad.	Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Grades?	Fine.
Huh?	Birth control.
Dad stop it!	Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
What you been up to?	Nothing.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --	Jesus all right enough!
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.	Huh?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.	And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?	That's besides the point.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --	Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --	-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --	-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.	Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?	I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?	Let me.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.	You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --	Well, we can talk about it.
Hi mom.	Hi Wendy.
Mikey Williams?	We were just riding around.
Oh.	It's really quite all right.
I'm thinking of going back to school.	Social work?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --	You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?	They say you never forget.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.	All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?	I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?	I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Reverend Edwards.	Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.	Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.	See ya.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.	Um, Libbets Casey.
Shit. You're not planning --	My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.	Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Would it matter?  And what's that?	You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.	Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
No one.	I don't have a girlfriend.
Where you going?	Out.
Did you tell Sandy?	Tell Sandy? What?
Wow!	Wendy!
You get in trouble?	Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Her name's Libbets.	Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Hood residence.	Charles, what time is it?
And?	Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
All my model planes.	The ones you built?
Want a drink?	Vodka?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?	Huh?
I love you.	That's nice. Are you drunk?
Nice kid.	Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.	About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.	Okay.
Duggar called him?	About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.	Why?
What about your shoulder?	Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
He would have liked that.	We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.	What I saw?
We're sure it's hers?	Has her books in it.
Forget your pager?	What?
That's right.	Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
That's right.	Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
He's asking everybody questions.	But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.	Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?	Huh?
You heard me that time.	She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.	The other guy?
Since grade school.	That's a long time.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!	Who?
My arm!	Who?
She used some stupid code name.	What was it?
You gave her gifts.	Yes.
Don't you pull that shit with me.	I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Monstrous.	Yes, and very beautiful.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.	Are you the leader of tis group?
What are we?	Nothing if not vampires...
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?	You said there were none.
I'm not your daughter.	Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.	I have. Or there would be twice as many.
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!
Stop pestering me then!	Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?	No. Laudanum.
I want more.	What have you done?
Why does he call you that?	Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
You... fed on me?	And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
It can't be -	It is! Take the back stairwell -
She's no vampire.	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!	Be still!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!	What danger?
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.	That's not so.
You want death? Is it death you want?	Yes...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?	And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
What do you want from me?	I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Diane!!!!	They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?	Give it to me!!!
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.	You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?	I can't go through with it, I tell you.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.	Dying?
Dear God, what have I done?	You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.	And if I don't?
I know. It gets cold so fast.	We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.	I don't know any hell -
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.	Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
You fool, what have you done?	What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where are we?	Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
Why do you do this Lestat?	I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.	Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
She's here, your wounded one.	What are you saying?
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.	Lestat, what do you mean?
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...	Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.	I tried...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?	You're not lying to me, are you?
The story about stakes through the heart?	The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
You loved Yvette...	Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.	I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?	Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Lestat escaped the fire!	He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!	Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Yes.	What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Wait...Did you say off-season?	July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.	Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Say yes.	No.
No means yes.	Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
That could break the machine.	Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.	I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
What do you mean?	Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Ray, I can't...	Can't what?
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...	This weekend?
Never do that again.	Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.	Fine. Show me the body.
Don't kill me --	Wait, it's Nancy --
Julie! Wait! You okay?	I'm fine.
You sure?	I'm fine.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.	He's in it with Willis?
Why are you doing this to me?	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.	We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Oooh, the mainland --	Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.	Why?
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.	I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Ahh, that feels great.	How's Julie?
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.	Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
He leave you?	No. I shot him.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --	And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.	Must have missed the sign.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.	Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.	So why are you still here?
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.	How's the water?
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.	You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Take this.	And do what with it?
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --	Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.	You collect these to sell, abroad?
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.	He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.	I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.	All the graves?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.	I donut understand.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.	No.  She shall not be left here.
Where's Thea?	I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!	Poor Cathy --
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?	I don't know now without my father.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?	She has never mentioned her family.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.	How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.	That your father and I ——
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.	Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Woman, what are you doing here?	I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.	I don't understand you.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.	If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.	Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
What is her illness?	Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
This girl --	This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.	We still don't know that it's the plague ——
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-	Listen to what I say --
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.	It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.	How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
George . . .	Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Good morning, sir.	Carter –– bank examiner.
Go through with what?	Suicide.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.	What are you, a mind reader or something?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.	Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.	I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.	I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
What'd you say?	I said I wish I'd never been born.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .	Our clothes are dry.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.	Made what?
Clarence . . .	Yes, George?
Poor George . . . Sit down.	Sit down? What are . . .
Hey, who's that?	That's your problem, George Bailey.
A boy?	That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
I know. I know. He didn't go.	That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
You sent for me, sir?	Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?	No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.	What's that book you've got there?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?	The Building and what?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!	I know. I know.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .	You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.	Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
What boat you sailing on?	I'm working across on a cattle boat.
She's swell.	Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Hmmmm . . .	Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmm . . .	Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?	Uh-huh.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.	Aw, forget it.
Yes, you bet.	Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.	I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.	He's pretty young for that job.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.	Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hey, George . . .	Hello, Violet.
Say hello to New York for me.	Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .	Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?	George . . .
Holy mackerel!	And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.	The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.	Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?	Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.	I'd like to do that.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?	I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?	Five hundred dollars.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.	In that place?
Oh, no.	Come on, tell me.
If I told you it might not come true.	What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.	Would you rather leave?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.	Thank you.
After that, who cares?	That does it –– come here.
Have fun.	Thanks for dropping around.
Where's your coat and hat?	Left them at the office.
What is it, a sore throat or what?	Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Where're you going?	Going up to see Zuzu.
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.	What plates?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.	Oh, shucks . . .
You can?	You going to the lighthouse?
Come on, you guys.	Well, I don't know....
For me...?	What the hell.  For you....
Wheee!  Faster!	How fast is enough?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.	What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....	Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Don't!	Stop paddling!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!	Back down!
No.	Good.  It's terrible.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!	Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Coming up!  Give way!	Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Coming up!	Gangway, Turkies!
You coming up on him?	You bet.  Hang on....
We're hung up here.  Snagged.	Can you get us a line?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....	If there is, develop it!
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.	Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
How long ago?	About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Mike's out there.	But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.	Got it.
What else is there to do?	You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Pop....	You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?	Not till next year.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?	Sean's still out there.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....	You said something about a camera.
Wait a minute....	Too late, it's written.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.	Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The what?	Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.	Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?	And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Eat Cheerios.	What're you guys doing today?
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?	Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
No.	Terrific.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 	Are you going to be able to sleep?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.	That's great.
That you were fired.	Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
I'll give notice.	Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.	I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Bullshit.	Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Martin, it could be anything.	What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.	What for?
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.	That's it?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!	Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.	Shouldn't he be at home?
Hi Dad.	Hiya yourself.
It killed her.  It ate her.	Shh.  Shhh....
We're going to die.	It's all right, we're okay.
How old is your cousin?	Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Get a dance yet?	Nope.
Tina Wilcox.	You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.	That's a crock of shit.
Give me back my hat!	Double nope!
Mmmmmm.	Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!	Name it.
I don't care.	I love it.
You're going sailing.	Maybe.
Wave to my son.	How the hell do we get him down. from there?
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.	I can get it.
He's going with you, Doctor.	No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
I'll need more men to look.	Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
What's your plan, Brody?	It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Sure am.	Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Well, not much longer to go.	What is it, 97 days?
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.	They're acting very strange suddenly.
My imagination isn't that good.	Honey, I gotta go.
Damn it!	Hi, baby.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.	That's a lot of ground to cover.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.	Let's not talk about that now, okay?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?	That we swim.
Don't think about it.  It's over.	It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
You're going down there again?	Yes.
After what happened to us?	I know I can capture it.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?	I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Finally.	How's your patient?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.	I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
It's too soon to move him.	So tell Calvin.
Honey, what is it?	Hydrophobia...
Come on.	I can't take water, Kathryn.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?	That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Come on!	You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
How is he?	Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.	... Okay.
That's right.	Who's going to do it?
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.	Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.	I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
I want that shark alive.	So do I, love.
Let's hope he knows that.	I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.	Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.	Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Philip.	Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
He's big as a bloody bus!	The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.	She, Mister Hutton.
A piece of pie on Sunday.	The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
He's a young one.	And big for his age.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?	Sure.  No problem.
This is where to be.  High and dry.	And alone.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!	The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!	No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Isn't this fun!	Can hardly wait to do it again.
No...  It can't be.	What, hon?
Gotta sneeze.	Don't you dare.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.	That?
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?	Calvin said it was all right.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.	Precisely.
Thanks.  Bullshot.	So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
No, South Georgia.	What the hell's there?
Polar bears.	Polar bears in Georgia???
I'll go with you.	No way.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.	Always do.
That's impossible.	I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.	So was Dad.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.	Don't hurry back.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.	It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.	It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --	Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
You'll spoil her.	That's what grandmas are for.
How come it's my responsibility?	Because....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....	Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....	I can't help it....
At least he doesn't have a beard....	Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.	Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....	I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
I see what you're doing....	I'm hungry, Mom....
Yes!	You can stay in my room.
Your father was six then.  Just like you....	I'm still five....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....	You're silly....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.	Thanks for the consultation....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.	I'll miss you....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....	I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....	It picked Sean...It killed your father....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....	Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....	Come on, I'll show you around.
I want you to give up your work....	Mom, please don't start that again....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....	I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
You look tired....	I'm fine....
You and Sean used to make....	I have to get this finished.
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....	There's nothing to worry about....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....	I don't want to talk about that.
It got him....	Why'd you come out here?
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.	I always listen to my feelings....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....	It could have been an accident....
I don't know how....	No one does till they learn....
It's just like driving a car....	Where do I pull off...?
You're impossible....	They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
How do you like flying?	It's wonderful....
Our little island seems to agree with you....	I have my own little island.
I'll nick the boss' plane again....	What?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....	I'm sorry...I....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'	You're the man who drives the plane.
Hurry!	Just like that?
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?	Yes I can....
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....	We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....	She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....	What's that....?
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?	I fly elephants for smugglers....
Yeah....	Still chasing fish?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....	She's a tough lady....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....	Oh, boy....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....	The females have eggs....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....	A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....	You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....	Put me down....
They won't fight with me....	Put me down, damnit....
Bad boy....	I didn't do it on purpose....
Office of Naval Research has some money....	Forget it....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....	Don't say anything about this to my mother....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?	As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
When I invited you...	We got it together, Jake....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.	So did I....
You sure you've done this before?	Lots of times....
How long have you known Hoagie?	What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long?	As long as he's been here....
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....	What do you know about him?
Shove it....	You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Stop that!	You don't like my voice...?
I don't like the song.	Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Holy Christ....	Mom....
What the hell are you doing?	I've got to get to her....
All the time....	It'll work....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....	Don't flatter yourself.... 
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....	I just want to make an honest woman of you....
She's in management....	I'm training to....
Cow tipping?	Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.	No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Did you bring it with you?	I hope I'm not intruding?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..	Since when did you drink diet soda?
What time is it?	Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..	Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Where is everyone?	I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
I haven't got it.	Then give me that Zippo.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.	How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
You believe me, don't you?	What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
God, it pisses me off, Ross.	No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.	You don't really believe this?
Jesus. What are you doin?	I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Now?	This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Listen, you don't havta come?	Hey ..
How do you know her hair's black?	Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
What do you want me to do, Chief?	I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Have you got a match on the bullet?	No.
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.	Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..	You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.	Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..	I've heard you call him Freddy.
Yes, Sir.	As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..	What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
No.	Why not? You heard my voice?
The elevator wasn't working?	No, it has a mind of its own.
Can I see your hands?	My hands?
Sorry?	.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
You know? How do you know?	Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Why can't I stay with you?	It's not possible right now.
Coz he thinks you're a witness.	I can't identify him ..
You do?	I'm blind because my father drank.
I think they're gonna arrest me.	I don't want them to arrest you.
What are you doing, Travis?	I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Why?	I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
You got a warrant for this?	Yes, Sir.
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?	No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
What does that mean?	You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
You think he still loves her?	Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
So tonight she confesses?	Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..	Even better.
Shut up, King Jay ..	No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!	Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.	I know about the bachelor party.
Who told you?	One of the accountants.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --	Could you just stop moving?
Listen to me!	No.
Didn't hear it.	There is something missing here.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.	No.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?	Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Don't let him stay up too late.	Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?	I see what you're saying.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.	"Something in the way.  Yeah."
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.	Oh come on --
Can I help?	Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.	Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, thanks.	Well, take care.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.	Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.	Absolutely.
... light.	Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.	Well, I'm happy for you.
Truth?	Sure.
Well.	Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.	Same to you.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.	Right.  I'll come in.
Oh God.	Easy, easy --
Another time, okay Dorothy?	Fine, I just --
If I said that, would you stay?	No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Why do you love me?	Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --	Tell me -- let me help --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --	I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
I don't like to give up.	Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
What about medical?	Of course, medical! _ 42.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --	Of course I know --
He's coming over.	At eleven at night? _ 70.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.	Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Forgot your keys --	That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
I'm sorry, I --	I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.	Okay.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!	Now you want Arizona dollars.
At last I find you.	Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?	Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?	I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
You love me now, don't you?	Very much.
What are you doing with me, Rod?	Huh?
You are not allowed to act this way.	Why not?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.	I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Thanks for coming.	I missed ya.  What can I say?
Oh, tell the story.	--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.	Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
You gonna get that --	Not a chance.
Marcee --	What DO you stand for???
I'm sorry what I said back there.	Don't be silly.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.	I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.	"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.	The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I'm fine.  What's up?	I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...	I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.	Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
I won't tell.	We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
I don't see any.	Funny.
Show me the animal, Jerry!	Right up ahead, buddy --
...once-in-a-lifetime.	We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!	What?
Her new boyfriend.	A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
You hate to swim.	People change.
No, Dr. Grant says...	Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
What did you say?	Nothing.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.	No, it's...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...	It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
It's not safe.	We have to help him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.	I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.	We're not going anywhere, I promise.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.	Here!
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.	What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Where's Dad?	Just hold on.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.	He loves you too.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?	Sure.
Absolutely not.	They're here.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.	No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
That does sound lucky.	It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.	Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
How would you classify it?	Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
He used to know me.	Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.	Really?  What do you do there?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.	You think they could talk to each other?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.	Goodbye, Alan.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.	You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.	Which one do you prefer?
We need to head for the coast.	Are you sure?
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?	She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.	You should.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?	There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Amanda!	Back out! Move!
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.	Just a little bit too much, I think.
Any damage?	Minimal.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?	It doesn't matter what I think.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
What?	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
I'm not going, John.	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
Oh --	-- my --
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Hi, Dad.	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?	That was about a year ago.
I could come with you.	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
"InGen."  What's InGen?	Where does it say that?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Where do you think you're going?!	To collect my fee.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
What is?	The velociraptors.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.	Good.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
What?	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
Come on!	Where's Kelly?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.	Funded by whom?
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
You've got to be kidding.	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
But would we get the phones back?	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
You shouldn't use my name.	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!	Shhhhh!
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.	Are you sure?
There you are.  Out you come.	Oh my God.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.	Oh my God.
Carousel.	A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?	Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.	They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
The what?	The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?	Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Okay, who's the jerk?	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
Why would they care what we think?	What kind of park is it?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!	We were right!
So what are you thinking?	We're out of a job.
Oh, shit.	Dilophosaurus.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.	It's my favorite.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?	Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!	I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.	The fences are electrified, right?
Ellie, com one!!	The other car!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!	What's that?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
I'm going with you.	Okay.
Come on, let's go.	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
It's all right.	Like hell it is!
That's right.  Will break through.	I get ah - -
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Oh, imperfections?	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Alan?	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Tim.	Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
These look kind of familiar.	Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
I threw up.	That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.	It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Go, go, go, jump!	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.	You have no idea.
What'd I touch?!	You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Yeah, they hate me.	You want to talk about this?
Hey, we were saving that!	For today, I guarantee it.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.	What kind of opinions?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.	Wu?
Tim!  Lex!	Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Tim, Tim, Tim....	Oh, I hate the other kind.
Go away!	It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Don't do that!	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Your silence intrigues me.	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?	You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Well?	There's no sign of him anywhere.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.	Sure.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!	Excellent.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -	Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...	Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.	Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Okay... well... I think it's this way...	Great.
Other guy?	Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.	That's my job.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?	I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
It's still on.	What?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?	No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake	None of that's true?
Oh?	You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Fascinating.	Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Uh-huh...	Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.	Great.	When can you do it?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.	How's that possible?
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.	Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.	Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
You know how to use one of those?	I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.	What is it really?
Fine -- terrible.	What was the matter with it?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.	You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?	-- Small.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.	I don't know what you could have read.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.	I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.	There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.	What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?	In a manner of speaking.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.	No, I left it in his office.
It's what I'm paid to do.	You're detestable.
To do my work well, I have little time for --	You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I did not realize it was obligatory.	Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
-- Eduard --	-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --	I know.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.	Why would you suppose so?
What's funny?	This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
How long were you and Eduard --	Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.	Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
You almost married recently, didn't you?	Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
-- I don't know the Musil district.	You won't have any trouble finding it.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.	They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.	People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.	Why were you given notice?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.	There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?	Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?	No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?	No, I suppose not.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.	That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.	It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.	When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
... A piece of paper ...	A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.	... A piece of paper ...
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.	It usually is.
It's gone out so quickly?	Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.	Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?	These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.	My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.	It's ... lovely.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!	To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Get the hell out of here.''!	Now Ann ...
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...	I photographed it extensively, father.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!	Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!	You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.	I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.	Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Man Eater!!!	A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!	Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
They were just tasting the berries.	Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.	What?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.	How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Did you fear for your life?	Yeah.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.	Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Why? She's a junkie.	She was with you after she left Frank.
Mm.	And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
-- May I? It's so --	Please --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.	Yes?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.	You think people hate you.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --	No.
What was better? I made better bait?	No, that's not --
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?	Mm.
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.	No, I'm look --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --	Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.	OK.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?	I go on rounds.
Well do you think it was him?	What do you think?
Did you like my friend Frankie?	No.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?	You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --	I don't see anything, do you?
You said it was!	No, I said what did you think.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.	Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?	Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.	Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --	-- Then you don't need me.
How can you do it to yourself?	I don't get you.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.	I don't like getting splashed.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.	Mm.
Is that all you have to say?	What am I supposed to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.	Don't touch anything.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.	OK.
Where, how?	I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.	How is it back there?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --	Well as a matter of --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.	Yeah.
That who?	Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.	Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.	Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
What?	Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.	It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Well --	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.	It's not so bad.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.	No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
Thank you. Goodbye, John.	Goodbye, Pete.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.	Two years ago? Sorry.
Not unusual.	Did she talk about him to you?
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -	Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Well?	Yeah.
Think this is our guy?	I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.	What else do you know?
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?	Trask --
Where is the child?	He's in his room, playing.
Does that distress you?	Not particularly.
What does?	The prospect of losing my child.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.	What about your mommy?
Greatest.	Greatest...
Show.	Show...
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?	Wow!  French toast, really?
What about my orange juice?	Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Mom, I mean dad...	Uh huh...
Mom, I mean dad...	In a minute...
I'm sorry.	That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.	Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Yes?	I love you...
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...	It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Wow!	You like it?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?	Sure.
What did you do when you were little?	I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.	Why does he decide?
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.	Sustained.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?	Yes, your honor.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.	Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?	Six years.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?	Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.	Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.	Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.	Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.	Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.	What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
I don't recall.	How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.	Ted, I'm leaving you.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--	Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.	I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.	Such as?
Wow!	I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.	I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.	I don't know, Jim...
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--	Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
'Night, Jim.	Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
What the hell is this?	Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--	That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--	Are you firing me, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.	Sure.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.	Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?	Right.
And?	I'm going to take it.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...	But it's not a year from now, is it?
What?	Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.	I know....I know.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.	No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.	I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.	Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
John?	Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.	Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?	No.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.	Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.	Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?	Got it.
You ever think about getting married again?	No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.	Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...	Ted, I just heard...
Where are you from?	Kham, Holiness.
Mama, my story.	Again?
Not the way to talk to people.	Can I do anything I want?
Where will you keep them?	Here. We'll collect them.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.	You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?	To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.	I will not approve it.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.	And we will begin with tearing it down.
Dalai Lama.	General Chiang.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?	Soon.
Did you receive the letter?	We did not.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.	Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Holiness?	Yes.
Me. First break of day.	At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.	I miss my brother.
Do I have money?	What do you think?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.	I am him.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?	Please.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.	Can India help us?
Has anyone died?	The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.	I will not go.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.	Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.	He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Me?	You will always!
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.	Does he have the spot?
What do you think?	True.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!	Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
You have grown up very good.	And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
Tell me.	They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.	Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.	Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
Hmm.	The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?	Oh yes.  I killed him.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--	Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
I'll sue you.	Go ahead.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.	I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--	Mr. Cyr!
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?	They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
We are here on official business.	Cocktail?
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--	I coulda shot you, you--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.	No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Promise you won't kill me, first.	I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
What's that?	It came from across the lake.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?	Raincheck.
I can arrest you!!	Then do it!!
Gee, that would really disappoint me.	Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
Where is he?!	I don't know!
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.	Right.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.	Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.	Nothing's real.
You're gonna be okay.	Guess I finally got bit.
Kelly Scott.	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
How big do the bears get?	Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.	I'd be able to see something.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Like little children.  You okay?	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?	I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Hector!!	Take him.
You sure?  I don't mind...	No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
If I'm ever in New York...	Yeah.
You think?	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.	Good thinking.
We set?	Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
I'm ready when you are.	Let's go.
What's that?	White perch.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.	So does he.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.	And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
This is a little different.	I can look at dead things.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
You're sort of a rude person.	It's just that--
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?	Was he swallowed?
What?	I thought I saw...
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?	I asked you to be nice to him.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.	Hector thinks you like him.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.	She's worried about the cow now.
I had a great time last night. Again.	Me too.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?	The somebody else part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...	Else.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...	It's ten after nine.
<u>You</u>?	It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.	Kelly--
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.	Well, except for the one girl.
"- every day."	Hot damn, Clarice.
You're all right! Where is he?	Get me out!
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!	Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -	Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.	Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?	Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.	Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?	Jack Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?	Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.	I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?	You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?	It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?	Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?	Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?	I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -	Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.	He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
What would it take?	Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.	But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -	Starling -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...	Sewing...
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?	They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.	Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?	I think so.
I am, yes.	May I see your credentials?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?	He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?	All that detail, just from memory...?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -	Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.	I didn't.
And the questionnaire...?	A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?	Why? Do you know something about him?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?	That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.	Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.	Was it a butterfly?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.	You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Two months.	Why so briefly?
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.	How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.	No. We just -
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?	Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?	And - one morning I just - ran away...
So you ran away...	No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?	Yes...
Yes... I did.	Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Time, Pilch! My move.	No fair! You lured him with produce.
Of course it counts. How do you play?	Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...	The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...	Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!	Let us go, miss.
Why didn't you bury those people?	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
He did?	Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
The Ottawa are gone.	Why did they turn back?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.	In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?	Yes. I want you to go.
My letter...	There was none!
One called Magua arrived.	He delivered no such message.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...	Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.	You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Yes. Go ahead.	What the bloody hell plan is this?
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.	What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.	He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
That is the truth!	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
And if we're unlucky?	You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Any powder?	: Only one or two loads.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?	We'll see in the morning...
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.	You're not coming with us?
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?	No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.	...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.	And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?	I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
What a place for them...	Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Things were done. Nobody was spared...	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.	And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.	General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Sir!	The decision is final.
Yes.	Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...	Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.	And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...	Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.	However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Such as...?	My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
My colors?	Carry them to England to your King with pride.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?	Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?	These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...	But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Be careful with it.	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
It's got Hazy!	What has?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.	What dead one on the ship?
No way...	Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!	No.
Where the hell've you been?	I got hung up!  Try this!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!	How do you know it was Williams?
Sixpack?	Why can't we pick up his signal?
No.  I'm just being friendly.	Good...It's going good.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?	I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
They know, don't they?	Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
What are you doing?	Seeing how my stock's doing...
We're on backup air.	How much time does that give us?
We made it!	Where's Jones?
Oh, God, she's out there...	Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...	Roger.
How do you feel, DeJesus?	Okay.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.	And it killed Bo?
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.	What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?	I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.	Do it.
Forty-eight hours!	I realize you must have gone through hell--
Made your million, yet?	Not yet.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!	Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?	Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Yes sir...	Hook's on 24...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...	I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
It's Sixpack!	I'm going to kill it!
Burritos...Enchiladas...	Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?	We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Clear for pickup.	Let's hope it holds.
Who were you talking to?	Sixpack...
Bitch!  Look what you did!	Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.	He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
I'll kill him!	Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?	Well, it's still a good idea.
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.	Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.	I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Because it's cheap like a budgie.	And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.	I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.	Apart from those shotguns.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.	Where're the others?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?	Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.	It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Nope.	Can I help?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?	No Harry, you can't.
They were going to pay, then?	It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?	I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Son?	Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137	Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
It's not him, Dad.	Try that one.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?	All right, Dad.
We gotta get those guns.	This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?	Er well, yes we do.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.	There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
	Just hold on, I got the keys.
Yeah, one of them's out.	OK, open the gate.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.	Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Well, what's going on?	I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
Everything all right out there, Tom?	Right as rain.
You and me, Tom.	What do you mean, me?
Tom, this is our case.	. . . What?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.	No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
That you, boy?	It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
It's pay day, ain't it?	I wanted to talk to you about that.
Go on.	I like your bar.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.	Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?	I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.	Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.	That's going on optimism.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?	When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.	Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--	Just shut up.
I don't know what the big deal is.	You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.	Oh, come on, Amado--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--	Leave your sister out of it.
That makes it okay?	They stole our land--
And what did she do?	Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?	Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who's "they"?	The--the officers.
Please.	It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?	No, sir. Not at all.
Why don't you start with that?	Yes, sir.
So you knew this young man before?	From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.	Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?	If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.	Yes, Sergeant.
Sam the Man.	Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
How's business?	Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Skinny?	We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Nice job.	Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.	You got to investigate. No question about it.
Whole different story; isn't it?	You're fired. You're outta the department.
You look good--	--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Suppose not.	You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
350 pounds.	What?
Come on in--	If it's too late--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?	No sir.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--	They fought against the Indians?
So I'm part-Indian?	By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
Dad, I talked to the track coach--	I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
I have a B average.	How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
How's your room shaping up?	Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.	You own this place?
Cliff--	You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,	He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Mikey--	Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.	You know who it was they dug up?
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.	This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
That where he was shot?	That's where he fell.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.	Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.	We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.	The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.	Protection?
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]	Aqui! [Here!]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]	Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Es muy lindo, su coche--	En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?	We was crossin' the river--
This girl is a friend of yours?	Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.	Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
I haven't been out here for a while.	You go by your old house?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?	You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He still living?	No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Besides my father, I mean.	There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Morning, Hollis.	Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
I got an idea what happened.	Do you?
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--	Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--	I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!	Well, you hire illegals--
Right. When he was killed.	A little older than Paloma is now.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.	You ever play one of these?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.	And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.	And when my father was Sheriff?
Mom?	Yeah?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.	I only went for my last two years.
How come?	Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
That's how I ruined my stomach.	I'm surprised he bothered with it.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.	Well, you were working there--
You built our patio while you  were on the county?	Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--	He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Your mother still doesn't like me.	I can't name anybody she does like these days.
People liked him.	Most people did, yeah.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--	Yeah.
I should get back.	Pilar--
We thought we were something, didn't we?	Yeah.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.	You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--	Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--	Pilar--
Yeah?	What was your father's name?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--	If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
We start from scratch--	Yeah--
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.	I been working on a few things.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--	This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.	You sell much out here?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?	Runnin' numbers illegal.
You going to tell her?	You going to tell him?
Hello, L.A.	Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.	How?
You ever been married?	Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
Why?	My life was too weird for her.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?	Nope.
That's Butterfield...	doorway) And who's that?
Thanks, Billy.	Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
How'd you spell that again?	D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.	Right.
You did.  Didn't you?	Why would I do that?
Who did this?	All right.  It was...
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.	About?
Death.	What about death?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!	It's him... it's him.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.	And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?	Yes.
Harry.	I'm no bodyguard.
Are they treating you okay?	I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?	They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.	Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
They were jealous of him.	Why?  Because he had you?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-	You didn't marry him for love.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
You said you weren't with him for love.	I wasn't.
What then?	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I was so afraid.	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.	And they all came...
No!  No!  No!	Harry...
... they believe you.	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.	So could you walk on water?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.	Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?	You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Why'd you come here?	You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Are you satisfied now?	No.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...	What about?
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.	Not much.
Are they all in the business?	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Oh yeah?	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...	Is that all?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.	Is that all?
Did she know where Nix was buried?	No.
... no...	He's better off this way.
That's where we're all going.	In my time, and nobody else's.
One question.	What?
Yes! Yes!	And he's dead?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.	Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
I'm thinking about it.	25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Hi again, how's it going?	Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Oh, hi.	Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Not really. How long are you here for?	I'm here for the week.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.	Ok.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.	OK, see you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.	I see them every morning.
Hans was very attentive to you.	I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Really?	Yeah, you don't remember?
Did I scowl at you?	No, you smiled.
I don't remember.	I know, I kind of blend in here.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.	Ok, whatever you want.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.	No, yes, it does...
What happened to your toe?	I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.
Do you know where we are?	No.
I'm sorry.	That lunch was the worst, huh.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.	I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.	Oh?
Lydia?	Hello, darling.
I don't know.	Is there anything I can do?
You know, eat healthier.	Alright?
Not all that pasta.	Fine.
Hello?	Hello, Bob, it's me.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?	Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.	Do you want to- 
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.
Hello?	Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Great.	Thank you, Mr. Harris.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?	Excuse me?
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.
See you later.	Bye.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.	Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
John! What are you doing here?	I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
It's amazing  there!	Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Uh..thanks.	Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
You never said anything to me...	It's probably trivial.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.	Bad?
Uh...sure...I...what?	Sushi.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?	I found the pentacle.
Yes.	And how would you describe him?
Seemed...on edge.	On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.	Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.	My secretary?
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?	Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You'll do it?	I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
He spoke to you?	Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.	You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
You fucking bastard.	Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Why are you doing this to me?	I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
What do you mean "don't worry?"	Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.	Kelson, hold on a second...
Oh my God!	...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Yes... and you are?	I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?	Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I'll bet.	On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
So...what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?	Please, the children.
And the point is?	At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
Peter, let go of the chair!	What?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.	I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...	Until it happens, you're still a human being.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.	We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
It's useless...look at him.	You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Good of you to stop by.	We millionaires yet?
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.	No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?	As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Are you saying he's legally sane?	Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
What's the matter with you?	He's looking right at me.
Thanks for handling this.	Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.	Where is she now?
Monica, what did you do?	Nothing.
I hate it.	Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
That's not funny	Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.	Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Monica.  What are you doing here?	Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Engaged.	To that stewardess?
Whatever.	You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
There you go.	What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
No I don't.	Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
That's not it.	Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
What are you talking about?	When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.	But you use potato?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.	It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
What?	You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
I'm an English major.  You like English?	Sort of.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.	Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.	I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
I don't know sometimes.	You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Like you don't give her a hard time.	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
And he's fine, girl.	How'd you get him to say yes?
What's up?	Just wanted to say good game.
Thanks.	But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.	You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.	Just like that?
You ever think about going back?	Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.	I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.	She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Didn't know you cared so much.	I don't.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.	I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
See you made it.	Yeah.
You having fun?	Yeah.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?	He ain't Spalding.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?	None of your business.
Why?	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
What was that about?	I know, right?
Forget Tonya Randall.	I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Then prove her wrong.	I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
That was so weak.	Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
Clothes.	What?
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.
I won.	I wanted you to.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...	I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
You weren't at my game.	Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
We're going to get some food.	Are you out of your mind?
Least you got your priorities straight.	I never asked you to choose.
You're what?	I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
So that's it, just forget about us?	Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
So...I guess I'll see you around.	Uh huh.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.	Yup.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.	Not for Quincy McCall.
So...how's the knee?	Getting there.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.	That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.	Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Like what?	Maybe go back to school.
You asked me what was missing.	What?
Give it yourself.	I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.	I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Yeah.	I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?	Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Whose truth are you talking about?	Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?	"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.	I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?	I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.	Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
You work too hard, Pop.	Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.	Okay...
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.	What?
Why?	A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
What's Mom think?	We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
We ain't got nothing to talk about.	I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
I ain't a damn liar.	Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.	What?
What do you want?	Came by to check on you.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --	I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
You smell like trouble --	I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --	Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?	I'm here, I'm listening.
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.	I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
What kind of Cancer?	Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.	It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Don't sit down.	...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.	baby, please, please --
Please put your clothes on, please --	YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
Honey.	GET OUT.
Your mother wants to hear from you --	GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Yes.	No one else in there with you?
I didn't realize it was that loud.	And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Yeah.	You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
Yeah.	I'm a bit of a slob myself.
got some coffee brewing, huh?	Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --	-- do you wanna cup?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?	I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --	-- is not my boyfriend.
Ok, ok. I'm back.	This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.	What's that stand for?
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.	I'm sorry.
Great, bye.	Bye.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --	Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
So you've done it --	Well I don't go out very much.
Why not?	I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
You really use strong language.	I'm sorry --
It's fine.	I'm sorry.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --	I'm sorry.
I lost my gun.	What?
I'm sorry --	That was so great what you just said.
It's ok.	You don't know how crazy I am.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.	Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?	What?
Just say no.	I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
What's your name?	Claudia.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?	yeah, yes, hi, hello.
What?	How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?	I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?	I don't know.
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.	Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
What happend, what's going on?	NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.	If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --	-- no.
DAD --	Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?	Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
You look like you've got money in your pocket.	Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.	This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?	I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
....do you know who I am?	You're a friend of the family I presume?
That's right.	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?	Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....	Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.	Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.	You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --	FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
You don't need braces.	Yes I do.
I've been a good worker --	Don't do this, Don.
...ah...	Where is he?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.	She loves you.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.	There's no asshole like you.
Do me a personal favor --	Go fuck myself?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...	Who are you gonna call?
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?	No.
I think you have the wrong number.	I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --	You got us a room so quick?
-- just to clarify --	So boring, so useless --
This isn't meant --	-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --	This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
She does.  From when you were a boy.	Mm. Hm.
She lived in Tarzana.	An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --	Go ahead and waste your time.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --	-- fuck you.
Where are you from originally?	Around here.
Why does that sound silly?	Well I guess it doesn't.
I wouldn'tve asked --	Not a problem.
Do you have your masters?	...this close...
Where does that name come from?	What name?  My name?
It's not your given name, right?	My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
And "Frank?"	"Frank" was my mother's father.
Kind of.	I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?	Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.	Oh yeah.
It's interesting.	Mmm.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...	yeah.
There's no disturbance.	I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
I didn't do anything.	Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
You on any medication?	No.
Will you say my name?	If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --	I won't.
What happend to you?	I got in trouble at school.
You want her right now?	Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
What were you saying, Stanley?	I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.	It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
How you doing?	I'm drinking.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?	Yeah.
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...	Did you ever touch her?
Yes you do.	Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I'm sorry.	It's alright.
Was it a call back?	No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --	I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
What does that mean?	The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.	-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --	Hang up the phone.
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?	-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Pink Dot.	Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?	That's it.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --	We need more dog food --
Be ready at two --	Should be one-thirty.
You ready to keep winning?	Sure.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.	Go to bed.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --	I have money.
...what...?	I have money to give you.
No, M'lady.	That is good.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
What is it, mother?	I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.	First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.	Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!	There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
How is he?	Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Three days.	Three days??!!
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.	So what has changed?
A simple theological discussion.	Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --	Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness.	Forgiveness?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!	No, not Louis!
Coming?	What use am I?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!	Come on...
He's going to kill you, Aramis.	Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.	Who?
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.	We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.	Who does?
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.	You are right.  But it is a trap.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.	Raoul --
D'Artagnan!	Athos, my friend!
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.	Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I heard your playing.	I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Raoul is everything to me.	I know.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.	You trust his character more than anyone else does.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.	I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --	No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.	Whose rooms are those?
Phillippe...?	How did you --
Are you hungry?	Just... water.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.	Who came?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.	And you never knew why?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.	I decided it this morning.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --	I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!	It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.	There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Silence!  I order you!	Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.	Thank you, your Majesty.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.	Forgive?!
Where is Michelle?	There.
Food, moron.	Thank you, Keeper.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?	Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Sire!  I -- How did you --	How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.	Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!	It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!	Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
Did you hit him?	I didn't hit shit!
Find out for me.	Fine...
I'll take the south end -	Fine -
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -	Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?	That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.	Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?	Could explain why Fleming was there.
And where the hell is Marvosa?	He said he was following up some lead.
Where is he?!!	I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
And what did you do?	I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
No...I'm in some trouble...	Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...	This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Holy shit -	Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!	Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.	Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
Are you a regular there?	Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
What would your - boyfriend - think?	Screw him!
Where am I going?	County jail - get in.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...	Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?	Could he handle a direct contact?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?	The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.	It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.	Book code?
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...	I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;	What else did you keep out of the papers?
If you can't look anymore, I understand...	As long as they're dead...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.	I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?	He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.	We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Is it weird?	The mark? Yes.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...	Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!	What is it?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...	...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.	We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Who is it?	Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
When are you coming back?	When I'm done.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.	'Changes?'
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...	VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There has to be.	There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
Something Lecktor said.	Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
I'll cover the back.	Stay in the trees.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...	Wait for the back-up! Will?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?	He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Where the hell's Graham!	He went to the men's room.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?	Tonic will be fine.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...	No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Reba...	Francis? Where are you?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!	No!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.	My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.	Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
'No' what?	Not me.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?	No.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.	'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?	No.
It's Will Graham...	Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Can you read it to me?	It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Linda King's desk.	Hi, Linda. ..
Okay.	We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
He's misunderstood.	Cut the general crap.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.	Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?	Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Do you remember what you said?	Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Can you quit?	No.
What will you do?	I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?	No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...	Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Lt. Fisk said...	Go on to the house...
Will it keep them out?	Yeah...
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?	Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
Are you gonna kill him?	No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
She got all right?	...after a while.
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.	Stuart is fine.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.	I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Pray tell.	I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
I don't believe in God.	You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Glaser Safety Slugs?	...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.	Tank you veddy much.
Sitcom...?	And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--	I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Andy?	Hi George!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --	Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!	But George, I like to push the boundaries...
We were just trying to push the envelope --	You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
So how can I help you...?	I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.	So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.	You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
I can't move my arm.	You've got good days and bad days.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!	Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??	Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
B-but I have them.	No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.	But it's only for thirty seconds!
What do you mean?	I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hi...	Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?	No thanks.
Andy, the theater's that way!	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
And all this will be for real?	If you want...
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?	They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!	Then your father's a wimp.
Hey Andy, good show.	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
Give me the book.	No!  Andy, don't do it --
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!	What is this, World War Two...?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...	No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!	And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
"Philosophically"?	The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!	It is apparently not working.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??	Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
We had a deal!!	I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!	I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Can I help you with something?	Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.	Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.	And you are?
Don't be ridiculous.	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You don't, do you?	If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.	Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!	He's going to pop!
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.	I got you.
All right --	Go.
I got a fibrillation!	Shit!  Apoc?
Give me your phone.	They'll be able to track it.
How long?	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Hello?	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Holy fucking shit!	Yes.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.	What do you know?
Why not?	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?	The Matrix?
Why do my eyes hurt?	You've never used them before.
This isn't real?	What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.	A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!	I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Do you know why you didn't make it?	Because... I didn't think I would?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.	What -- what lesson?
How does she know?	She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
What did she tell you?	That I would find the One.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.	Morpheus, I don't know --
You're the Oracle?	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Yeah.	I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.	How did you know...?
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.	Who?
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?	Honestly?  I don't know.
Hello, Neo.	How do you know that name?
Of what?	They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
Uh-oh...	It's going into replication.
Are you all right?	... right as rain.
What did you just say?	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
What is it?	A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
Go!	We can't leave him!
What?	I believe I can bring him back.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.	It wasn't fast enough.
Are you all right?	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...	Guns.  Lots of guns.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.	He's alive.
We need an exit!	You're not far from Cypher.
Tank, you're hurt.	I'll be all right.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...	Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
No.	Anybody wanna have a game?
Hey, come on...	Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Drinks for everybody Tony...	Giovanino!  Where have you been?
What happened to you Flash?	Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
It's the truth, I swear.	All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.	Wouldn't bother me.
Hey...you got nothing here.	I could have told you that.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!	I understand.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.	He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?	I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Michael, give us a lift.	OK, get in.
Disgraceful.	Ok...that's it.
Out!!!!	C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?	Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
Charlie, this is business.	'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.	'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
You're really crazy.	You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.	I know.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.	That's nice.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...	Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?	Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Well, maybe you missed something?	Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.	What was it?
Nothing.	No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...	What is it now?
Bore.	A paper on that one too?
Take your time.  I don't care.	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.	You're intolerable today.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.	Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.	But...
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?	Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?	No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You mean it's heisted.	You could say that.
How much?	Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?	Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.
Have you got a minute?	Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.	No.
What, honey?	I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---	We've got some things to discuss.
Who's Annie?	From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.	Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Honey, please.	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.	No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yeah, but --	But what?
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?	I'm sorry, I don't recall --
What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?
I would prefer some peanut butter.	How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Hello, Beautiful.	Hi.
-- Did I hear 'business'?	What 'business'?
We have an arrangement now.	What side of the industry did you say you were on?
In my sleep.	What'd it say?
'Yes'.	'Yes' to the deal?
It's going to be great --	Do you think I need a haircut?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.	How nice for you both.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.	For how long?  And why?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.	Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.	I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
That's it?	Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.	So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?	Certainly, Bill.
And what do I get?	You get not to go to jail.
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?	Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Yeah.	'It's up to Joe', huh?
Can't, sistah.	Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Not time yet.	Make it time.
No, I come to see Doctor.	Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Don' need you okayin'.	Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?	Sure.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.	Are you?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?	Do you love Drew?
Come again?	When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Susan?	Yes?
Goodnight, Joe.	Goodnight to you, Susan.
Yes?	I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Oh goodness, no.	Then why are you here, Joe?
Very well, I'll watch.	Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.	That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
She's in a great deal of pain.	Yes.
Joe, I'm with Drew.	Not now.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --	I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?	I don't know.
How long have you been standing there?	I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Where are you going?	To bed.
Thank you.	It was everything.
I like you in a black tie.	I love you in an evening gown.
'Love will find out the way'?	It's a saying.
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
No --	I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
How are you?  How're you feeling?	'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?	Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?	What do you mean?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.	Of course.
What's it like where I'm going?	Can you keep a secret?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.	I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?	I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?	'Fish'?
I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.
And I don't give a shit.	May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Uh --	Yes?
What the hell do you care?	I was just asking, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.	With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Okay.	Get him in here.
I told you to shut up.	Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
You are --?	'...Yes --'
Yes.	Death!
You want me to be your guide --?	You fill the bill, Bill.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.	Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Excuse me?  Could I say something?	Of course.
'Yes' what?	'Yes' is the answer to your question.
What are you talking about?	What you were talking about.
Where are you?	I'm here.
Get what?	Time.
I'm sorry --	In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
The 'question' --	Yes, Bill.  The question.
Hi, Bill --	Good morning, Quince.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.	You think Drew will go for it?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.	Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.	But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --	And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.	So what's wrong with that?
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.	Don't get dirty, Dad --
Aw, you're tough.	I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.	You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
You're terrible.	I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
What is it, Daddy --?	Nothing.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.	Yer damn right.
That was wonderful.	Yeah, it's good to get together.
Where's Joe?	Joe?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --	I'm sorry.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?	Oh, yes --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.	Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Nothing lasts.	I agree --
Why?	I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
47.	I think I know her.
Should I wear it?	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
What can I do for you, Leonard?	I'm sorry... um... ?
You don't know?	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
What makes you think he's my friend?	Seen you together, that's all.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.	Hi, Leonard.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.	Leonard.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...	That's right I did, didn't I?
Where'd you get it?	Interested in buying one?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -	Don't say anything else.
Is that what your little note says?	Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.	But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *	Tell me about her again.
How do I know he did that to you?	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.	Where is he?
My wife used to call me Lenny.	Yeah?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?	I told him about your car.
What's wrong?	Somebody's come. Already.
Neither do I.	Don't protect him.
How?	Get rid of Dodd for me.
Don't talk about my wife.	I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Calm down.	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Yes.	You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?	* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -	Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.	Thank you.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!	Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -	That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Lenny, is that you?	John Gammell?
Things change.	So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.	You don't have to remember to be hungry.
You're living.	Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.	Probably left it in your room.
What do you mean "bad news"?	She's involved with these drug dealers.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.	So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -	That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
How do you know him?	I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
What's wrong?	There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
This is a drug deal?!	That, and your thing.						   *
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *	You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
My wife wasn't diabetic.	Are you sure?
It is now.	You can't just take it!
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *	Why would I have a gun?
Bullshit.							*	His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
We know these people...!	Grieve elsewhere.
Oh, yeah...	So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?	There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...	Recruit us to do what?
Where's the new drop point...?	They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Just came in.  She's still alive.	Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
We're not certain...	You said Nazi Low-riders...?
So...?	Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
My end?	25% discount on the load.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.	Really?  So, what is this, a party?
I thought we had to meet the Man.	You do.
We want it back.	Okay.
The Keys?	Havana.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...	Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Were you born in Havana?	Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
How's he not your husband?	I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
And why should continuing excellence cost more?	Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?	What do you mean?
Good samba dancing...?	Zero risk.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?	I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, chica.	Hola, viejo.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.	Do I need it?
Is this the protective male talk?	This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
...in the morning.	I'll be on board by noon.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?	No.
Packaging?	Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?	'Cause she will tell you.
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"	"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
What do we got?	Five minutes...
Verdado where?	It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Go ahead.	Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Detective Crockett.	What's your Miami PD badge number?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.	Okay.  What's up?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?	NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
How?	We don't know.
Yeah...?	Sonny...?
They had me from the gate.	I don't understand...
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.	Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Oh, good...	...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?	We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Why?	A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Equipment?	Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Then what were we talking to you for?	I had to lay eyes on you.
This the load you lost a while back?	It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.	Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
I gotta, I gotta go...!	Alonzo...
Beg pardon, ma'am?	Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.	Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
What you gonna do back there, East?	Lotta rich women back there...
Must be some mess back there.	Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?	I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?	Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
You think I'm lying!	No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.	What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.	M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
For money.	For money for what?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...	Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
What's in your socks?	Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!	I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.	Whatsa matter now?
You don't seem like no fag...	What's that supposed to mean?
What for?	So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.	Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.	So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.	This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?	I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.	He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
They wrong?	No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Hey -- whatsa matter?	I'm wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!	Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Thanks, Joe.	Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
What you got me up here for?	Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I'm going to Florida.	This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.	You bet I do, sir.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.	Well, not too, I mean, a little.
You really want to do business?	Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Looks like a cheap hotel.	Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
'Figgers.	...He had a bald skull and...
Years?	Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.	Stop shitting me, man!
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.	Shit.
Dad...I'm...	...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Where you staying, Dad?	The Hilton.
How far?	About ten kilometers.
No, I'm not afraid.	Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.	Beats working.
How's it feel?	About as good as it looks.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.	He wasn't even in the car?
You got your stuff?	Yeah.
What?	After we're outside the kogus?
What?	I know where it is.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.	Yeah? Where?
Billy, what's the matter?	My passport!
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.	Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Know what?	Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.	Mr. Yesil.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."	Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Peter...	Yeah...?
The Department of Public Health...	...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.	No, you talkin' at me.
Its muscles are locked.	Oh, Jesus!!
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...	Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Is there a switch?	Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!	Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
But the power...	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.	Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
Which way?	Across both tracks!!
Just inner chambers...	But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...	Manny...
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!	Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...	Maybe they lied to you.
Metaxonycha Godmani.	So?
Great crowd.	No such thing, baby.
Oh, no, you were-	I was just late.
It's me. Can you hear me?	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
No, Jesus, no.	Toss the flare down!
It's no use! They know we're in here!	They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
It worked before...	The scent won't last...
Hello.	You the bug lady, right?
What?	She used a baster.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?	What is it?
It bit you.	No shit.
My God.	What?
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...	I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.	I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.	Following me?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.	I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
But what?	Nothing.
Pretty rough so far.	The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...	My daughter must be going nuts.
Thank you so much.	My pleasure.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.	She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Done?	Yeah, thanks.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?	Perfect.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."	Show me the way?
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.	You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
See, isn't this nice?	Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?	Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.	C'mere, I'll show you.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?	I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
It'll only take a second.	I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
You can--you have the "gotta"--	The what?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.	Why would you lose me?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.	It is.
You've been out of your room.	No, I haven't.
Now don't fuss, Paul.	Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--	Be my guest.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?	Maybe.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.	You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.	Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
You really think Sheldon's out there?	Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
You don't think he's dead, do you?	He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.	Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.	No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.	I'm sure you're right.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?	We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?	Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.	It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--	Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.	Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
How I usually find you, Nyah.	How do you that.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.	Oh, I am.  Later..
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.	Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.	Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.	To do what?
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.	Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.	You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
What was the top bid?	Why, you going to make me a better offer?
What you got there, mate?	A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Before we kill her or cure her..	Right.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.	How much longer before you can reach him?
How're we doin', then?	He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  You just looked as if you did.	No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.	What if I pay the rent?
What are you doing here?	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?	Indeed.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.	At least you walked.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.	Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
What's you name?	Ethan Hunt.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.	Which is?
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.	This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
How's it going?  Everything okay?	Just like old times.
Just like old times?	Just about..
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?	Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
I want <i>you out of there.</i>	Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.	No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.	Why did you phrase it like that?
Like what?	'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?	Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?	You were there.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.	In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
'Terrorists?'	Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Excuse me?	Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.	Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?	You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.	I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
No, I don't.  But in this case -	In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.	That simple, huh?
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...	Left jacket pocket?
Now how to get in there.	No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..	You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
To friends.	Yes, Anatoly, yes.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!	So what do you suggest?
That's S.O.P..	S.O.P..
Only four more cars.	And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Krieger can get it.  Right?	May take a little time.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?	If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
You were in the car!	I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.
What?	Take off your God damn coat!
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?	No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
What are you going to do?	I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
May I come in?	Sure...
I didn't say that.	You didn't have to.........
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.	Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Go ahead.	Theyíre dead.
No sir.	One hour.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.	Yeah.
What?	Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
I don't quite follow you.	Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?	I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.	Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.	That depends.
On what?	Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?	Like Job?
Mm - Hmmm...	Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?	I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.	It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.	Bank?
Merci.	We're not outta here yet.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!	Just waiting for you, tubs.
Give me the God damn gum.	Just don't chew it.
Higher.  Higher.	Higher.
The package is in the open.	Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.	Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.	If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I thought I'd take some now.	What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
I guess.	Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
You're going to use Walter?	He's our guy.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..	Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.	I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!	We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
Whatís going to make him do that?	What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.	Youíre probably right.
You got it.	And get a doctor.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?	Keep counting Claire.
Jim, itís over.	Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
What's going on?	I don't know.
Thirty-two and change.	Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?	Twenty minutes.
Whatís the problem.	Connection denied.
Who's dead?	Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
You're welcome.	I'm going to bed now.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.	Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Where's Ma?	Bed.
I'm getting married.	Again?
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.	I didn't give you away the first time.
Mona?	What'd you do to your hair?
You're my father.	Alright. I didn't see you here.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.	And what did they say?
What's wrong can never be made right. 	Let me come and talk to you.
You are going to marry my brother?	Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.	Excuse me.
Where'd Johnny find you?	He knew my husband who died.
When you get engaged?	Yesterday.
Why you talking to me?	You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Your blood.	All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
It's so bright.	I've never seen a moon like that.
This time I was trying to do everything right.	Don't just become excited.
You don't get along with anybody!	What did you do?
Who painted that?	Marc Chagall. A Russian.
This is your place.	That's right.
He's coming.	Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
No, I'll tell him.	No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?	You? No.
You don't want the fish.	No?
What's the matter?	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Have Something.	I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?	Bobo, take the cart away.
Yes, on the floor.	This is a good suit.
What about the wedding?	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Have you told her we're getting married?	Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.	In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.	And who's gonna pay for that?
Will you live here?	No.
How's the mother?	She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Did he tell her?	Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
No. But I have a hangover.	Where's pop?
What? He's in Sicily!	No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!	She recovered.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.	You gotta date?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.	What sins have you to confess?
Talk to him.	I will. But I must find the right moment.
Moving in?	I came right from the airport.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.	She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
So.	Where is she?
My mother's recovered.	You're kidding?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.	You don't know where Loretta is?
Can I get another one of these?	Definitely!
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.	I'm not disturbed. By you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?	None of your business.
Nerves.	I think it's because they fear death.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.	I'm too old for you.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?	Sure.
That's my house.	You mean the whole house?
I don't know.	You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!	You were a tiger last night.
Burn them.	And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?	Not at all.  They could be carried.
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.	Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...	He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.	But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
King of the WHO?	The Britons.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?	I am your king!
Well, how did you become king, then?	The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
All right!  What do you want?	We want ... a shrubbery!
What is that?	We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!	Oh, please!
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.	Had enough?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.	Course I have.
I'll do you for that.	You'll what ... ?
All right, we'll call it a draw.	Come, Patsy.
Well, what are you then?	I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?	I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.	This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Who ... Who breaks out?	Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!	No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What with?	Just keep me covered.
What?	It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
We shall attack at once.	Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Who are they?	Oh, just some friends!
By what name are you known?	There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!	Greetings King Arthur.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.	How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.	Who did we lose?
Old woman!	Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?	I'm thirty-seven.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...	Well ... I AM king.
... But all the decision of that officer ...	Yes, I see.
... but a two-thirds majority ...	Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.	Shut up!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.	Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Exactly.  So... logically ...	If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
What is your name?	My name is Sir Launcelot.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!	What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!	What is the capital of Assyria?
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!	I think I could pull through, sir.
Really, I feel fine, sir.	Farewell, Concorde!
Gosh - Is he all right?	You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....	Is it?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.	But, Mother ...
But, Father.	Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
How?	Well ... I'll tell you ...
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.	... and you'll come and get him.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?	No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.	What?
Yes ...  make sure ...	Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
The Castle Anthrax?	Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Camelot ...	Camelot ...
Quick!	Why?
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!	No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.	I don't think I was.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.	No, no, we must find the Grail.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...	You got my note!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...	I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Bravely ran away, away.	No, no, no.
I speak as I find, Archie.	Not down south you don't.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?	It's better than shovelling horse shit.
It's only grief makes her like she is.	Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
What?	You know what I mean.
Which one of us is she flirting with?	The good-looking one.
You've got three broken ribs, man!	I've got my duties to attend to.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.	Oh, I'm much more than that.
What's your name?	Mary Taylor, sir.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?	I hope to go up next year.
Hey, Barney.	Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.	Yeah, yeah, I did.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?	Yeah.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.	A situation?
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--	I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --	Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...	And that is my last word on the matter.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.	How will I know?
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.	That's not good enough.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.	You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.	She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
Don't think I can't persuade her.	I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.	I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
What do you know about the Highlands?	I am a blank sheet.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.	Quite.
You sent for me.	I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
You're injured.	It's nothing.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.	I'm not married.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.	I do what I do.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.	Yes, ma'am.
They're ready now.	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
What is it, John?  John?	I heard something.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Ma'am?	Yes?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!	I'm breaking no promises!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!	For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!	Then why send me back to them?!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.	Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
We're going to lose.	You can't know that for sure.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?	Who?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.	Of course.
Where did you find it by the way?	Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.	No, indeed.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.	Whom?
I'm sorry, ma'am?	Cold is good!
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...	Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--	I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Unwell?	I understand he was in a fight.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.	No.  I shall be out walking.
Who told them that?	I have no idea.
Why not?	I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Ma'am?	Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Where is my son?	Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?	You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Could you play ARCADE with that?	Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.	How do you do that?
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.	What the hell are you talking about?
What do you mean by "weird"?	Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?	It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Where do we go?	My house.  I want to try something.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.	Nick, what is it.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...	...but then it hits the relay stations...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.	No I'm not...
Jesus Christ!	I can't believe you made it!
What the fuck is that?!	Screamer.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.	I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...	Give her a chance, will you?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.	I'm going home.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!	I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.	I'm going home. I'll call you later.
So what's the problem?	There is no problem.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?	I agree with what you said...truly.
Yes...what is it?	I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?	That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Wow!	Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.	It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
No, no, I'm fine.	Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Can you tell me what happened?	No. I can't.
I think I've been hurt.	Oh...
No.	But, this could be serious.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.	Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 	Good luck!
Don't stop!	What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.	Do you know them?!
No... but...	Keep going. Go around to the back.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.	It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
To my audition.	And who are we auditioning for today?
Wally Brown.	And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
No, we don't.	Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Yes, Sir.	Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?	I just wanted to come here.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?	This Denny's.
You see what I mean...	Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.	Find out who they are?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.	Where at?
Palmdale.	Damn, that's a long drive.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.	Making ends meet, huh.
Hardly.	Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not here...no thanks.	Not a coke or anything?
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.	Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....	What's going on ?
Where are we ?	No time. Get him up.
What about Matt ?	Leave him, he's dead.
McCay knows ?	Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?	Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.	So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?	Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?	You don't. It's random, there no trick.
I don't get it.	It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Just stop it. End it here.	It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
What are you DOING here ?	I work here, remember ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.	43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !	I don't help criminals.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.	Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.	Yes, sir Mom. 
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.	You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Hand me the 3/8ths.	Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When you are ready.	Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
You did.	That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....	Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?	Checking........
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?	Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?	I am thirty two.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.	Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.	What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...	John, sir.
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.	Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?	What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.	Then what do you want ?
Bruce has just awaken.	What ?????
What is Bruce doing ?	I don't know.....
What's next ?	I have a turn for the worse for the team !
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !	I can see that but where ?
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.	Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !	Thank you.
Really ? On a date ?	Yes.
Are you okay ?	Yes, Excuse me for a second.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??	Which one, this door is locked !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.	We just having our first date when you showed up.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?	I'm fine.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.	Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
This is California, anything is possible.	Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.	I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Okay, no problem.	Okay thanks, atta girl.
So, what's on your mind?	Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.	No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.	No it's okay, I understand, really.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.	Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Seriously.	Great.
So you're saying...What are you saying??	Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
There's still a big spot on the floor.	Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?	Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.	Thanks, I needed that.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.	Hi Dad.
I don't know if I want to.	Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.	You're being narrow-minded.
Maybe he's wet?	Maybe he's hungry.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?	Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.	I'll try.
And she saved it.	Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Do you have any pictures if her?	I've got something better.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.	Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Hi.	Come on in!
That's okay.	It's just a corpse.
My mother can't have any more kids.	Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Hi.	Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?	No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.	Then I have come to the right place.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.	O.K. Thank you very much.
Getting off please.	Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.	It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.	Just remember the needle in the haystack.
I think it's cool.	You would.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.	At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Does it work?	Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Uh oh...	What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.	In the tar??
Where are you going???	Owh...
Hey look!	This is a totally barbaric custom.
Right.	And you'd be my cousin?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.	Good. I mean...
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?	I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
No?	I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.	Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
I don't think the color of the interior is....	Rose this not the place to be having this...
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?	They're great.
But...are you engaged or something?	Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.	That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed?	Committed.
A secret, I like that.	This is it I guess.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.	Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
I think this place is just fine.	You know how I feel about you.
Bye Aunt Rose.	Bye Niece, Vada.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?	I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?	Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?	Yes, I do.
Something wrong?	Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.	This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?	No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Did it hurt a lot?	You have no idea.
Let me hold him.	O.K.
Arthur!!	Vada!!
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.	I like to buy off all the railroads.
Wanna play?	No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?	Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Ex...ex, ex...	My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
It's there.	Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Excuse me, what about the job?	Pardon?
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.	Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.	I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.	I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.	Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.	Did she ever see Vada?
Goodnight Shelly.	Goodnight.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.	Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!	It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!	Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Well, you were pretty great!	Is it really your camper?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...	Pointing upwards Look...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;	Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?	They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Of course not.	Then who's it for?
Dad??	What?
Are they ready yet?	No, sweetie, not yet.
What are you doing.	Feeding my fish.
Why not?	He was allergic to bees.
Did I kill my mother?	What??
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.	Are you sure about all this?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.	No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Hi.	Hi, is Vada home?
Sure.	Thank you. Bye.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?	It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?	Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.	I wrote a poem too.
Really?	Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Is that your camper?	Yes it is.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.	It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
He won't give it to me.	Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?	Can I use your bathroom first?
No.	Come here, sit down.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?	Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
I'm hemorrhaging.	What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Oh great!	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
If I do it, can we go?	Uh huh.
Your lip bleeding?	No.
Hmmmm, interesting.	What?
Do you remember her?	No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Heaven.	I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Sorry.	What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.	I told you i'll get in trouble.
Pacifist!	I am not.
Bed wetter!	I stopped that!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.	We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Can we go yet?	Go???
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.	I wanna live with them too.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.	Really?
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.	Hi Vada, can you come out?
I dunno..	Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Have you ever kissed anyone?	Like they do on TV?
Like this?	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Close your eyes.	But then I won't be able to see anything.
Say something it's too quiet.	Umm, Ummmmm
Yeah, it's in the contract.	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
You don't miss much.	Part of being a New Yorker.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.	... weeks.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.	Kindred spirits.
I've lost interest.	He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
We'll never be the same.	I have a suggestion...
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.	You have a real philosophy of life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.	I can see why.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.	Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!	The man you love.
Zit cream?	I wish.
Neosporin?	Try less appropriate.
I give.	I can't even say it.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?	What do you suggest?
I suppose it's too late to start over.	It's too late to start over.
Two words.	Major.  Dish.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.	Oh, you're more than okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...	Well, we're...
Excuse me?	I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
What else did he tell you...	... you hate weddings, you never go.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...	... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...	... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.	... that this is all my fault?
I've been calling for days!	Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.	Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
She's too genuine.	Hate that.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...	She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Where was that, Florence, huh?	Firenze.
Should I whistle down a cab?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.	Boy, those were the days.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.	Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.	Like I said, dazzling.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.	Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.	Have you.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...	We danced to it.  Just like this.
Takes me back.	Well.
I'm up against a deadline.	Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.	It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?	You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.	"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.	A bad combination.
What's up?	Shhh.
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?	I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Lower.	The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...	I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
And to m...	... and you knew about this.
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!	What is that sup...
You got the money?	Right here.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.	Well, that just happened that time.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.	You got a real good memory, Star.
What?	Grand Old Opera --
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.	I won first prize.
You're from out of town?	Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Barnett?	What?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it	You're so good.
Am I disturbing you?	I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
I said, I've been real tired.	Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.	I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.	You get her those Vitamin E right away.
You bet.	Okay. Thanks.
Yes.	Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.	Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.	He knows better.
What?	They can come to the concert in the park.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.	Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?	Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.	Who the hell is he?
He has that sign with the tree.	What does he want?
It's on National television, Barnett.	I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
You want anything?  A drink?	Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?	Sure thing.
Okay.	Okay.
President?	When is it?
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?	Not yet.
He's my father.	Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.	What is a turkey shoot.
What?	Your wire Ester - she passed away.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?	Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?	A little. What do you need?
What's this?	Replacement party.
Who's that?	A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...	I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?	No.
What kind?	Nash.
I feel really good.	How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Fungus?	He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Listen. Maybe I should go...	I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When did you start singing?	When I was little, in church.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?	No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Do you like him?	He's a member of our congregation.
I don't know who you are.	What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
What?	Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.	I have to go.
I'm twenty-eight	Oh.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.	Oh.
Premeditated murder.	Oh.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?	What...?  0h, yes.
You know who that is?	Yea.
They said go see the chaplain.	I'm sorry but I have to go.
What time?	Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?	Hundreds of times.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.	Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
What National TV...?	You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
I mean...	Mary?
We just got a gold record.	Do they have a show to give it to you?
Probably a little too long.	Do you study at all?
Pleasure	Where is she?
Oh --	We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Peter Finch -- he's English.	I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.	I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.	I'll be dammed.
You think it will?	Sure thing.
More or less.	More or less...
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?	Yes you are.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?	Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...	What...
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.	How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?	Are we in a big hurry?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?	Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?	What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?	Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Who's the song bird?	Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.	Tough titty, it's mine now.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.	Good...yuppie piece of shit.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?	Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Sorry about that.	Don't worry about it.
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?	No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.	Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?	You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Tell me about the purity.	It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory.	Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?	No.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.	Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?	Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?	Yes.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.	No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---	No fuckin' way!
Yes.	Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
And they made the first move?	Unfortunately, yes.
Yes.	Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.	Survival of the fittest.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.	Capt'n!
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.	That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.	So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.	Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
How's it working, Scotty?	Perfecto!
It's gonna be beautiful.	Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?	Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?	Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
It sure is.	They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?	Lose 'em.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?	Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.	One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?	Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.	Don't call my men assholes.
They done that too long in my family.	They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Where' you goin'?	Out.
Boy - you hear me?!	That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?	That's right.
Want to keep your job, boy?	What d'you think?
I know.	You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Walker and Williams.	What did you say your name is?
And his age?	I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.	Oh yeah? That's good.
You working?	Yeah. On the section gang.
My father's the preacher.	Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?	No.
They must work on the section gang.	That's right.
How come you stay 'round here?	Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
What d'you mean?	You almost got into trouble back there.
Surprised?	No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Hi.	I thought you wasn't comin'.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?	It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?	Don't call them that.
What about him?	He could live with us.
My kids want me to teach them.	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.	My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Don't look so scared.	You jivin' me?
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.	What about your boy?
Don't deny me, Duff.	Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Hi.	Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.	What the hell could you do?
Day work.	'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
You heard me!	I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.	Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.
A whole lot, Frankie.	Like what?
Like a home, for one thing.	You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
That's right.	Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!	Sorry.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.	Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
What did you say, boy?!	I said, she's in great shape.
How often does he get like that?	Whenever he's got an edge on.
Come on, Pop.	Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Going back, huh?	That's right.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.	Okay.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.	Don't look like there's a right way.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.	Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.	Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Baby - want you to meet Duff.	Hi.
No. Why?	Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Let's stay here, Will.	What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Pour your own trouble, Will.	Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
Let's go.	Anything you say, baby.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.	You hate Raoul?
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.	Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
How long's it been?	I'm still on my honeymoon.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?	I'm fine.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?	Of course.
Take this off.	He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
What about her?	Of course...
What are you doing in here?	The Elders, mon...
What you lookin' for, mon?	A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.	How's the villa's security?
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.	You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.	First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?	Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.	This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.	It hasn't yet.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.	I've arranged for him to work with us.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.	I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.	You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.	What about McCoy?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.	Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.	You'll be linked during the entire operation.
You've got your orders.	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Tell me the words.	The words?
I saw your girl yesterday.	I don't have a girl.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.	I an' I, man. I an' I.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.	Can you walk?
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?	No problem, amigo.
What?	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Bright enough to be dangerous.	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.	So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.	No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
What are you talkin' about?	I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
Want to fucking answer them?	No!... No...
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?	People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Where did you here that?	Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Case... are you okay?	I don't know. I don't know...
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.	What's my end?
What about before that?	For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.	Too late?
It sounds like you.	Put the gun down, Case.
Case... Are you alright?	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.	Something exotic I hope.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?	No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.	I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.	Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."	Nice.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.	Oh I know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.	Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.	Thanks.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?	Exactly.
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.	Right. 7:30.
No Roger from op/ed?	Nope.
Forget it.	I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Senorita Josie.	And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?	Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?	No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Wow. It's packed.	It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Wings?	We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?	Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
I think it's pronounced gauche.	Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?	Betty.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.	It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
How many times have I fired her?	Five-- Six--
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?	Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.	You're a sick puppy, Geller.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.	Oh. Right.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."	Kristen got a quote?
Gus?	No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
That's your story!	You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Oh my god.	Dude, you rock!
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.	You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.	Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--	I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!	Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.	No. Josie, this is real.
You're twenty-three years old!	With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.	Really?
I love the way she writes.	Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
So what are you thinking for college?	College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.	Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Are you--scared?	I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.	You remember that story?
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.	Why do you do that?
You have to say that. You're my teacher.	I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.	That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!	What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, I'm alone.	It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?	Yeah, I have.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?	You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.	Wait, I was going to tell you--
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.	I finally found my story.
I don't know.	The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Aloha! Welcome!	Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?	Well, a ball player.
Wow - I-	Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
He <u>has</u> to know...	Everybody knows about--
He sure is big, Jack...	And heavy...
Where're we taking him?	Where?
Uh-huh.	He stayed a long time.

You got your room straightened out yet?	It's getting there.
I told you I want that room unpacked.	Oh, come on Dad...
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?	What are you talking about?
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?	What about it?
You two got a thing going, or what?	She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?	You got a problem with me, Grady?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?	Yeah, why?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.	What the hell are you talking about?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.	It was okay.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.	Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.	He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?	Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.	Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.	Yeah.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"	Wow...
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?	I don't know.  Where are we going?
Here.	What's this?
You want to talk about it?	My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.	Why won't you talk to me?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!	I can't!
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?	Sure...go ahead.
Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?	All of them.
You're going out?	We're going to bed.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Hi Mom.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.	It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.	They're healing up nicely.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.	Research.
Horseshit.	No, she's right.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?	When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
You like gymnastics?	I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.	You did it the other night.
What are these, beauty marks?	Those are ancient history.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?	Fuck off.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?	Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.	Sounds like a rough time.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?	I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?	That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.	With Hypnocyl?
We can try again.	Everybody take five.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.	Anything?
I've heard crazier things this week.	All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.	Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Who is he?	Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
My God.	That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?	You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.	Don't worry, it won't come to that.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.	Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
That's enough, Kincaid.	There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.	For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.	Uh, fourteen.
Hi.	Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?	I'm a vegetarian.
No!	Night, night, Honey.
And then I... right.	Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?	Fifteen million dollars.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.	Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?	No thanks.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.	You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.	Oh -- Okay.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?	Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Are you busy tonight?	Yes.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.	You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.	I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Floppy, huh?	It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
So who left who?	She left me.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Why?	Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...	Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?	Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.	Oh no no -- no.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.	I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'	My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.	Well, get a message through to him too.
You know what they say about men with big feet?	No.  What's that?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'	You have a stunt bottom?
What?	Don't ask.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.	I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.	I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.	That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
This is certainly... ah...	I only found out you were here yesterday.
I thought I'd give it to you.	Thank you.  Shall I...
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...	What's the thing?
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.	And what would you say...
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.	That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Excuse me.	Yes.
No.  Not true...	C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...	Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.	Tony -- what do you think?
Is this your first film?	No -- it's my 22nd.
Da Vinci?	Di Caprio.
Yes.  What do you think?	Well, yes.  Groovy.
I was called and I came.  What's up?	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!	Well, thanks, that's great.
What do you think?  Good move?	Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.	Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.	Still, not sparkling.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.	Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.	And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
I agree.	I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?	Ah... yes, enormously.
That's right -- Topol.	But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Martin -- your customer.	Can I help you?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.	Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?	No -- did you?
Well?	She's perfect, perfect.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.	Is it someone we know?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.	But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...	I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?	Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.	Two?  That's it?
Right.  No one else?	Absolutely not.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'	Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.	Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
I'll talk to you in the morning.	Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.	Right -- let's talk about rent...
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?	Yes, that's perfectly correct.
And yet you suspect her.	Yes, that is correct.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...	I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?	Y-y-y-yes...
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!	I-I-I...
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...	You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!	Who? Tell me!
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!	Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.	I wanna report a robbery!
On this ward?	Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.	Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.	Right!
I'm not finished yet.	Go on...
You men remain seated!	He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Yes, Miss Ratched?	Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
What's your name, buddy?	B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.	O-o-o-oh...
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.	W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...	Go ahead! Go back!
In ya go...	M-M-M-Mack?
Sock it to 'em, kid!	Are they all crazies?
In there.	Wow! They're so quiet.
Wait a minute...	It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.	Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
What for?	What for?
There they are!	Hey, what's that?
It's the questions she asks.	Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Yeah, my feet are cold...	My feet hurt...
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?	A pecking party?
Lobotomy!	Lobotomy?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?	Now, what would I be trying to say?
Okay, sucker.	Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!	What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Don't you have any clubs?	No!
Why not?	I'm not running a charity ward...
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.	What's he talkin' about?
Hear what?	McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Who told you that?	Gary Blinker...
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.	Hold it a minute.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!	Yeah, Mac?
Oh, what's that?	Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Poker!	I see.
How are you feeling?	Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.	Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?	'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay	'Kay!
What's troubling ya, buddy?	I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You look pretty healthy to me.	I'm the next one.
You think it's funny, huh?	Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.	Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!	Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Got a cigarette?	Sure...
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.	Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
A dime.	Okay. Who else?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?	'Kay...
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...	Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Please follow me.	You an' me, Chief.
You comin' in to hold my hand?	No...
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.	Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?	On what?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.	Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.	I don't have any.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...	This way, Mister McMurphy.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.	After you, ma'am.
How 'bout twenty?	Now you talkin'.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.	Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!	Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.	Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.	That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...	Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?	I-- I must've misplaced it.
Excuse me?	Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.	I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?	Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?	Why?
So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind...
No, really.  What's she doing?	Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?	No.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?	It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.	Exactly.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.	Except possibly that.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.	No.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.	But, Faith--
Hello?  Is anybody there?	Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
WAIT!!  Where are you?	I'm at the airport.  Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.	Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
You're limping.	I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?	NO.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.	He's safe.
Why are you asking me this?	Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Why not?	Because.  I know where he is.
Why?	Because-- I want you to be happy.
Mickey Spillane.	Mickey Spillane?
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...	Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Nice dress.	Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
So were you.	Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
No.  Are you're leaving?	No.  I just came by to apologize.
Yes.  I am.	In that case... no...
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.	You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.	That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...	There is no us.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?	Tonight?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?	A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?	Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I don't believe in statistics.	You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
I don't have an Amana freezer.	It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I don't know.  I don't think so.	So?...
Come on, it's not so bad.	Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
It's a miracle.	It's a coincidence.
It's still the new year...	What about your job?
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.	You're coming with me?
You okay?	Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.	"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.	You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.	Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
A phone message.  Only--	Only what?
Your brother?	What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
What's that supposed to mean?...	Nothing.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--	Her brother.
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.	I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?	Packing.
Why?	Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.	I know, but...
Amazing...	He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.	Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?	No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
How old are you?	What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
Giovanni, I want to thank you.	I thank you.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?	Right.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.	You used to love it when I called you doll.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—	If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.	Gimme.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?	Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
You said they was only going to talk to him.	That was the idea.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.	He probably gave 'em an argument.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.	Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.	I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Mm—hmm.	You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.	Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.	Maybe.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?	Don't say that!
Wow... .	What do you weigh these days, slugger?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?	Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
See! You don't understand!	I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
It was you, Charley... .	Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?	I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
I think we're O.K.	Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I want to be a teacher.	A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.	Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
Want to go out and have one with me?	In a saloon?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.	I am?
Were you really a prize fighter?	I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Terry!	Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Why, Terry, who said it was?	Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
His— racket?	You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .	I know... I know... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.	Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Edie...	Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.	I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.	I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Terry, no, no... .	Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Every one of 'em... .	You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.	You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.	He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.	He wanted to see me again.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.	And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.	Someone else c'n take your confession.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .	I don't want to hear it in there.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.	A question of who rides who.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.	Good luck.
This is my business.	Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?	A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Who asked him here?	Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
You all right, Nolan?	Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
You still call it ratting?	Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?	If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.	Down to the wire?
So help me God!	Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?	Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
I think you could have.	If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.	Raise a hand to me and... .
Better.	Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!	Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You ought to go home and take care of that—	First things first.
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?	Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.	By way of Chicago?
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.	It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.	I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.	I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Listen— Nolan—	What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Leave her alone, you fiend!	Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...	..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?	You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!	Okay.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?	I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
What do you mean?	I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
What can we do?	I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
The ropes are coming loose.	Be careful!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.	I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>	I should hope not.  I hate you!
All right.  Put it on heavy.	My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
...And what is this?	A symbol, Master.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.	It would seem so, Master.
The moon is almost gone!	Ahh, there is yet time.
Your pleasures of course!	You mean...!
You may take her now.	Is there time?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.	Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
I could make her another Cleopatra...	Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?	Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
I want to speak with you, please.	Who is it?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?	From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?	I know a Glenn.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?	You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
You didn't visit him in prison.	He didn't want me to.
But you spoke to him on the phone.	He'd call every once in a while.
Ask him his name.	Who are you?
I'm not dressed.	Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?	She's coming with us.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?	Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
Do we need him?	The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.	There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?	What's he do now, tell fortunes?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.	Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.	Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.	They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
And she saw you?	Yes, she did.
You find out?	Yeah, I did.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.	Half for doing what?
They look like plain old rocks.	They sure do.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.	And then they'll kill 'em.
We made it, didn't we?	All you gotta do is get in.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.	Jack --
You talked to him?	In the trunk, yeah?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?	When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.	And what happened to Carl?
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.	What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?	Call and tell you.
Leave it where it is.	Wait.  You not Adele?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.	Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Who?	Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?	I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.	Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.	Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?	I don't smoke.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?	Not until recently.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?	For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Where's your gun, your pistol?	In my bag, in the car.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.	You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
You don't act like it.	What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.	I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.	Faye Dunaway.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...	Peter Finch.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?	Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Unless you wanna tell me.	He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
Don't leave me.	Those guys bother you?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?	Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.	Yeah, but in a nice way.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.	You believe that?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.	Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
You're not dumb.	I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!	I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Take your sunglasses off.	I see better with them on.
Wait in the car.	You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Looks like tonight.	You know who they are?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?	I don't know.  I never used a gun.
I know what you're talking about.	You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?	Of course not.
Have they got Midge up there?	What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.	A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
You busted out?	I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
There were others.	Yeah.  That was the ninth.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.	Hejira.
I'll send it to you at Glades.	Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--	Glenn?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.	We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?	I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
You there?	Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.	Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.	You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.	No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
I can tell.	I <i>was</i>...
Here?  In this house?	He said he stayed with Maurice.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?	Your dog was killed?
Technically.  They're separated.	Oh, he's moved out?
Can we change the subject?	What're you doing at Glades?
He doesn't even look like that.	No?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?	He's pretty laid back, confident.
You gonna go get him?	It's possible.  Why?
You here all by yourself?	That's right, just me.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?	No.  Course not.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...	Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?	Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.	He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Nervous?	Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.	Sir, I --
What lizard?	The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!	Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.	Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.	Power dive!
Good shooting, Danny!	Good shooting, Rafe!
How could you do this?	The Colonel helped me work it out.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.	Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?	Yeah.
Then why are you looking for her?	It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.	So what are you saying?
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.	You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.	Fuck you.
They're all over us!	Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
I got a half a tank.  You?	Little less.
Fun today.  Like old times.	Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.	No.  You're trying to beat me.
It's shorter than our practice runway.	They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?	The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.	He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.	I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.	Thank you, Sir.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.	Bombers.
How often you fight like this?	Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.	We're all going away.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.	Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.	Brilliant, Admiral.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.	We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.	Have the planes made it to China?
Hello, Lilla!	Peggy Sue!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.	I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Let's go.	Good—bye, Grandma.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?	Stag movies. Smokers.
Do you have to wear that hat?	It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.	Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.	We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.	It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.	Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
I don't get it.	That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
What's the matter?	It's that jerk Walter.
We're here on the sofa bed...	Charlie...
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.	Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?	I'm not going.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.	Charlie! Am I dead?
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?	Maybe I blocked it out.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?	Why wait?
Right. I promised my mother.	Is this slow enough for you?
This is a mistake. We better forget it.	You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.	And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...	That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..	How'd you know about that?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.	That's real big of you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.	You're going to listen to me.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?	Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.	How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?	Of course.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.	Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.	I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.	Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?	Touchy, touchy!
Terry! Slow down.	What, why?
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?	That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.	I wish she hadn't.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.	It must run in the family.
Don't get your hopes up.	Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.	But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.	They care about you. They're just a different generation.
You think so?	Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.	Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Thank God for that.	Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
All right. But this better be good.	I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Hi, Dad.	Doing some shopping?
Quiet today?	This morning was good.
Yes.	That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
He'll win.	Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.	Of course, dear. You're home now.
When did you start drinking coffee?	Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sort of.	What about?
Who was that man?	It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?	It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?	For what?
And the butter.	You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.	Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
You think this'll cheer Dad up?	Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.	You have an incredible memory.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.	But accidents can happen.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?	I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.	Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.	Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What a great kite.	I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Okay. I promise.	This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.	I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.	I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.	That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?	Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.	Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
I was building a doggy door.	God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...	Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.	He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...	I'll be fine, Dad.
So where're we going?	Anywhere but here.
What's his name?	Zowie.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...	You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.	Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
It's getting pretty late. We better go.	Yeah...
How can he not have a heartbeat?	Maybe it takes a while...
Do you really think so, Andy?	Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Aren't you giving an exam?	I said, don't worry about it.
Don't apologize for me.	He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
Jerk... What did you say?	I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?	Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Fuck you.	Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!	The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?	That's not what I said.
I'm not going to die.	That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Whatever.	I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.	Don't do this, Andy.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.	I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...	About my blood work?
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.	Sounds delightful.
Innocuous?	Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...	It's okay. Can I sit down?
I buy that.	As in, the vegetable?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...	Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Who'd you get?	What?
Rayisha.	Rayisha. Very nice.
How did they find out?	One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
I've considered that.	What happens?
A regular all-American guy?	I suppose you could say that.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?	You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
What makes you an excellent lawyer?	I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What do you love about it?	Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?	What?
Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.	Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Do you take risks?	In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?	That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Some do. I didn't.	As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?	One. Here, in front of my ear.
What's Dr. Gillman say?	Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Mom?	All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.	Objection.
Ms. Burton. You're black.	Is that a question?
In what way?	Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.	Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Objection!	I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.	I'm not worried. What are you doing?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.	Right.
Great.	Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.	Not especially.
Lots.	Who?
Don't know, Joe.	Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Joe?	Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?	Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Yeah. Do I have a case?	Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.	Any women on board?
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?
You taught him a lesson.	Yes, we did.
Attorney for the plaintiff?	Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Let's continue.	You had one guy "like that?"
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?	Helloooo...
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.	Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... But we shouldn't have fired him...	... It's time to get this society back on track!
Oh, Lord....	It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....	No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.	Show me your eyes.
Power cells.	They're coming.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.	I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?	Saw something I didn't like.
Back to the ship, huh?	Get out of our way.
What, you're afraid?	Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.	Can we switch?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.	During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?	Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Little ratty-ass.	Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --	Let's wait on the power cells.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --	He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
Dancin' on razor blades here...	I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --	I never said I was.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?	Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Smoke screen for what?	For your own fear.
How much you weigh, Johns?	What the hell's it matter?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?	We're just burnin' light here.
This does not help us, Johns.	-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.	What, you're goin' off, too?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.	Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --	Company's not here, is it?
Oh, no. No, no, no....	Rain.
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --	There is no "safe."
Where's Mr. Johns?	Which half?
King Tut's tomb....	Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Very big beads.	Not staying in here another....
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.	Say that again.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....	For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Think about that reward, Johns.	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Well, what's it look like now?	Looks clear.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.	No. She's not.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?	Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.	Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?
Dr. Zaius --	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.	Do you have any weapons?
As you wish.	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.	Good luck then.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.	What's so special about him?
The blood transfusion.	Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.	And they fell out of the sky with you?
You didn't think so then.	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Geiger counter?	Yo!
Which direction?	That way.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?	What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Hmph.	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.	Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.	He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
It's no use ... there she goes.	Forget it. Abandon ship.
Gone.	We're here to stay.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.	You don't seem very cut up about it.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?	long pause) You know it.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.	Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing	Climb off me, will you!
Scarecrows?	Let's take a look.
Can we take a dip?	Okay.
We got off at the wrong stop.	You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.	What is it?
Lucius.	I think you're making a mistake.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.	What?
Gorilla hunters ...	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.	Why special?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.	My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.	This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.	By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
ThatÕs a lie!	Mind your tongue, madame.
What about me?	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
No.	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Of course.	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Stop right there.	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.	All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
It's humiliating.	Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Would you like to come along?	We can't.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.	God bless you.
Do you believe him?	Like you, I find it difficult.
...but 'Lias is still out there.	I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
I SHIT on all o' you.	KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.	How the hell did he get away?
Sarge?	Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.	Yeah, what is it?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.	Fuck you bitch.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?	Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.	Shaddup bitch.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 	Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.	Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Come on you can do better than that!	Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!	Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...	I got one...
Taylor! Francis!	Over here!
...beautiful night.	Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?	Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?	In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Okay - got light duty, three days.	Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!	Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.	Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.	He dugged his own grave.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.	Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...	Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...	I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.	Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.	Well..
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?	I really don't know.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?	I'm supposing.
What's the matter?	I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.	I'm sure you have.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.	I haven't been invited.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.	Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Don't I even get my face slapped?	Would you mind?
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?	Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...	Immigration Officer?
They might think I was running away from something.	Possibly, Miss.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.	I see.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.	He got in here how?
Bad?	Bad enough.
What time is it?	Quarter after one. Why?
Cold?	Is this the best you can do?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.	I didn't notice him.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?	Absolutely sure.
They're going to arrest me.	I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?	Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.	That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.	How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.	But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If you're doing all this just for me.	That, and the fun of it.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.	And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Would I want to?	Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Yes, Miss.	I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.	Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?	Ale. I don't mind.
I'm sorry.	Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
FLorida?	I've never been to Florida.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.	We wouldn't have met at all.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?	You were there when I last saw him.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?	You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
If I understand what you meant by that.	You understand perfectly.
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.
I expected nothing else.	I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?	Very ridiculous.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?	You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.	I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.	Who's Goble?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?	Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.	If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
I go home and paint the kitchen.	For two hundred?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.	A thousand.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?	In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?	Sometimes.
And without much discrimination.	Leave that one lay.
How are your teeth getting along?	The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
What's this in favor of?	I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.	How's life treating you?
How about a cup of coffee?	No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
How are you two getting along?	Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?	I wouldn't know.
I have a warrant for her arrest.	That must hurt.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--	Would that make me a heel?
Information.	Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.	Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?	Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.	I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
I had a father who knew how to steal.	What?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?	You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.	Mr. Mitchell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.	I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.	Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
What do you want?	See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.	They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.	How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.	Floater?
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.	Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.	I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Send that?	Would you?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.	Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.	The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.	Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
Right.	I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?	If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
No suicide.	Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Scotch and plain water, I think.	Warm water, no doubt.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?	I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.	Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.	I'm interested in who handled it.
He checks too.	That leaves two strangers.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?	The card says so, doesn't it?
No.	I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.	Aye.  You have a point there.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?	A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
So-so.	Who's the girl?
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?	You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.	Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
What's this?	What does it look like?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.	You already have the checks, darling.
I told you she's just..	A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.	It's kind of you to see me.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.	What a shame.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?	Yes.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?	Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To Ann.	To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.	Yes.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.	That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
How's Mary?	She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.	No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.	Thank you.
So it's all worked out perfectly...	That's her.
What did you think of that Wadja film?	I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.	Too bad.  What did your father do?
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.	And you're at this third stage
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.	You just might.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.	Let me see.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?	Yes, finally.
What period?	Suez.  1956.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?	Take a look at these.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.	The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.	She said that?
You're so famous now.	And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.	In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.	Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?	Not yet.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?	No, Bells Beach, Australia.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
We gonna jump or jerk off?	My man!
Don't screw around man, pull it!	You do it... you first!
What's this?	Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
You gotta tell me where she is.	And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Why should I?	What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?	No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
You never were...	I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Yeah?  What?	Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.	Yes, sir.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?	Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?	What that?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Good move.	Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
They don't go for the vault?	Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Yeah.  What's your theory?	The fucking punks are surfers.
Oh well he must be a surfer.	Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Johnny, it's the only way.	Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?	Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?	He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?	Angelo, we gotta talk.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.	Did he rob it?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!	Yeah, or cashing a check.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.	Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
What do you want?	Shrimp and fries.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?	I'm serious.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?	No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Nice place.	He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Meaning you were expendable.	We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Look at you.	What?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Those are cold.	Warm them up.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--	Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
My name's Johnny Utah!	Who cares!
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.	Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Thanks.	Anytime.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.	What's that, General?
Where the hell is his body?	There's no sign of it.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...	You're not getting any navy contracts.
There's no way you could know that.	But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?	No.
It's... it's not like that.	I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You don't know anything about me.	I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --	You what?
I... I would take advantage of it.	How?
Mind if I turn on some heat?	If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.	You're not from L.A., huh?
So do day jobs.	Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.	You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
You're joking.	I never joke about money.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.	Can I have some chips?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.	Do you plan everything?
Uh-huh.	Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Try a strawberry.	Why?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.	Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
You really are a very beautiful girl.	Just a romantic, that's you.
What do you like?	If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
No?  Why's that?	"Occupational hazard".
Not... quite.	There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Four thousand.	Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
This isn't a date.	Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Hello?	I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
You liked the guy, though.	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.	Television?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.	Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.	I think it's exciting.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.	Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?	Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.	Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Edward, I can't.	Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?	You won't.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.	Where are you taking me!?
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.	Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.	I more than liked it.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.	Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.	It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!	Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I got tired of hating my father.	It was good.
You're packing.	I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.	Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
What time's diner tonight?	Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --	Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.	Goodbye, Bill.
Looks slow tonight.	Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Couple a hours.	Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Yeah, what?	Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?	Of rent I do not bullshit.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.	What?
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.	Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
What is with you?	Excuse me?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.	I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Would you like to try it on?	'Scume me.
Yes?	Do you remember me?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.	I just might do that.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.	Then I'm here till I die?
Brides often are, I'm told.	I do not marry tonight.
Who are you?	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
He knows I do not love him.	"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Rest, Highness.	I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
You mock my pain!	Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?	You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.	I will never doubt again.
Singed a bit, were you?	You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"	Gently!!
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?	I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.	Anybody want a peanut?
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.	Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.	I'm waiting!
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --	-- what? --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --	-- where?
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.	The body?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --	What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Has it been fifteen minutes?	We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.	How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --	I don't be-leeve this.
What?	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.	Because I can stop now if you want.
Yes.	All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.	As you wish...
Double it. My Princess must be safe.	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!	DEATH FIRST!!
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.	I swear it will be done.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.	Of course.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?	Yes.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.	Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.	That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
No --	-- offer me money --
-- all that I have and more please --	-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Humiliations galore!	That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?	More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
You are wonderful!	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-	You're sure nobody's following us?
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.	I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Yes.	Morons.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.	For the Princess?
Inhale this, but do not touch.	I smell nothing.
You're just stalling now.	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
What's so funny?	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?	An hour.
You feeling any better?	A little bit.
You are sick, that's why he's here.	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,	"Honeymoon,
Yes, sir.  Thank you.	Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Good, what is it?	Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.	Where?  What?
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.	Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Assume away!	Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?	You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.	Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.	But what if the play was a hit?
What scheme?	What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.	Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?	It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.	Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Where would you like to eat?	Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?	Right.
What kind now, Leo?	I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.	Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
What are you doing?	I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.	Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Maybe it's not true!	No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.	No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?	I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!	What???
Max, I...	What is it?
Don't help me.	He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?	Yes.
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.	With whom?
But he has long hair!	Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.	You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.	You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!	All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.	Got dag pa dig.
Min Bialystock.	Nice girl.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.	We can't play today?
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.	Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Of Siegfried...	Wagner...
Hindenburg...	Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...	The Graf Spee...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.	Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."	"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.	Vat?
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.	Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.	What have you done, LSD?
What did you tell the people?	I told them we invaded England.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.	In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No. At least I don't recall.	She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.	Tell me all about her.
Very early. Dawn.	Of which morning?
The following morning. Sunday.	No one met her?
No.	You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
I live there. Alone.	Someone is sitting in that window.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.	If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Now, look...!	Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...	No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Let's all talk about Mary.	Who are you, friend?
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?	Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...	I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.	You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!	Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...	How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Forty thousand dollars.	And the police haven't been able to...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.	With the forty thousand dollars?
Yes.	Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.
Yes?	May I talk to you?
I'm Mary's sister.	Lila.
Here?	With you.
What should I know?	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.	Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...	You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?	How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.	I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Where... can I stay?	First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?	You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?	Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.	Yes.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 	Sam! Why call when we can go?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.	Just wait here?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.	Does that mean we can't...
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.	We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.	Watch your tenses.
Sorry.	Hospital clean.
What?	The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.	Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
It's regular. Okay?	I could stand something regular.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.	What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.	Sam!
For what?	This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 	It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?	We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.	Sam, let's go get married.
Dirty night.	You have a vacancy?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.	I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.	Los Angeles.
I imagine so.	It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
You go out... with friends?	Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
You should... mind it.	Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Why don't you go away?	To a private island, like you?
You're not going to... to your room already?	I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Phoenix?	I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...	Very early. Dawn.
No, m'am.	Then I'm free to go...?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...	I'm sorry.
May I see your license?	Why?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?	Maybe you saw Mary!
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.	At this hour?
Recluse. Kinder word.	You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...	Arbogast.
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.	It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I'll get your bags.	Haven't any.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.	That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.
They thought she'd be coming to me.	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.	Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?	Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?	Did I?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.	What--special autopsy?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]	[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.	Indeed, he has often told me.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.	I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Gosh, you had me fooled.	Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--	I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.	Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.	How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 	Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.	Maybe you're right.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?	Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.	You found Buckley?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?	Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.	Do you have many patients, doctor?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.	Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.	No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
Yes, why?	I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
But what about lunch?	I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.	Delighted, I'm sure. 
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.	What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
That's the way I feel about it.	I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.	It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.	And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Are you giving me this straight?	Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.	You mean he was colored?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!	Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!	What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.	All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Which one is me? The horse?	Get out of here.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?	I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!	No kiddin'. What's your idea?
What!	About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
No kiddin'?	Almost certain.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?	Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.	Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?	It's all yours.
I told you he was a sore.	Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.	Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?	For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?	They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.	Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?	I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.	No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Why?	You go in for dangerous things.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.	I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
What is it? What happened?	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!	You're insane.
But I have some friends waiting.	That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
What are you laughing at?	He can't hear you.
Yep. Everything settled.	Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --	Thanks.
A place you've never been.	That's the physicist's playground.
Why am I doing this?	It's an experiment.
Could be.	What universe are you in, Paul?
Dysfunctional --	That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
They're filthy, Mother.	Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
I know, Mother.	But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.	I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?	What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!	But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.	What did you expect?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.	Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.	Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Actually, I am, though.	You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.	That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.	Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.	Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!	Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.	But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?	No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.	Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!	Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?	Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!	You won't die, Rose.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.	I don't want to know...
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?	She's getting herself up to go out.
There goes Mother.	Yeah.
He kissed her.	Is that all?
She's putting the titty back.	Buddy, that was my place.
What's goin' on?	Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?	Hello, Daddy. How are you?
How could that be, son?	Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?	Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Is her husband sick or something?	No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!	She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.	It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?	Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Of course.	I think we both know her.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.	Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.	But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.	I don't care where the polecat studied.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?	She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She does look a little peaky.	No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --	Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.	Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?	That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!	Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, sir.	All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?	Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.	Well, it has buttons.
What have you got in your hair, girl?	My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?	Oh, anywhere downtown.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?	Yes, sir.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.	Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.	Oh, no, sir.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.	I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!	Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Well, it was a silly question.	He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?	What's the use, there ain't none.
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!	Tennessee?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.	What?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.	All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Galley what?	Page proof of a book I'm working on.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?	Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?	That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
I see. Outside it.	That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Um-m, well...	Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Yes, dear, what is it?	Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.	She looks terrible, just awful.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.	It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?	Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.	Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Oh, no, ma'am.	Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.	Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Well, you run on now.	Yes, Ma'am.
Yes, Ma'am.	Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Never again, never again...	I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.	I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Rose, you don't have to.	I don't mind.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!	Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I... I can explain...	I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?	... okay... you made your point.
You think it's that good?	I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?	Now you know what to watch for...
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?	Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Kittle...	Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?	Alright!  Alright... put me down...
What'd I say?	It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
You shouldn't litter.	Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.	I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.	Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Sons of bitches!	We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I can work this.	No you can't.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.	Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
"A.D."	Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Wh... what... ?!	Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
It doesn't say that.	No, but it should.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.	You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Where we going?	We have to find Kittle.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.	Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You live like a pig.	Can't you say something nice once?
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?	I'm waiting till the time's right.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?	No.
He tried to kill us.	We've got the tape to prove it.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?	It's our job.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.	"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...	First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.	Let's hope.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.	Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
What... ?  Not you too?	He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?	Gimmie a minute.
How'd we do?	A.D. is a C.P.A.
We're screwed.	I'm well aware of that.
This shit was Ming.	That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.	Yoda will always be with you.
I can't do it, Ben.	You cannot escape your destiny.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!	I can't kill my own father.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.	I can't see.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
I told you to remain on the command ship.	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
They are clear, my Master.	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Luke.	Hi, Han... Chewie.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.	It'll work. It'll work.
Shall we try and go around?	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.	Charges!  Come on, come on!
The code's changed. We need Artoo!	Here's the terminal.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.	No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Well, look at you, a general, huh?	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
What are you telling them?	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Proper?!	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!	Quiet.
What do you remember?	Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.	She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.	But, why must you confront him?
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.	I will not fight you, father.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.	I will not fight you.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.	Never-r-r!
You!	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.	I told you, my car broke down.
The future is ours so let's plan it.	Janet.
Oh Janet	For you.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.	Dammit, Janet.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.	Yes.
Oh....Say something.	Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Right!	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Hello.	Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.	You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?	Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?	Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
What a guy	Makes you cry
What guy	Makes you cry
Want to come again and stay	Oh my, my,
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.	That ain't no crime
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.	Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.	Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.	Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.	Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Are you - giving a party?	No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.	Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...How's the turtle food this week?	...Fine.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.	...I'm sorry.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.	Absolutely.
I just dislocated my finger.	Ohh!
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?	By accident?
What's funny?	My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
I would say you're very shy by nature.	...I suppose.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.	Morning after?
Would ya like a glass of water?	...No thanks.
D'you really wanna call?	Yes, I do.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?	It's fine.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.	I should leave.
...T-thank you.	Do me another favor?
I always knew you was pretty.	Don't tease me.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.	Don't want weak legs.
...And he called the reporters --	Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
What was that you said about a pet shop?	...What?
...Can't do it.	...What?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.	What're we going to do?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.	Paul.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!	It's not your house --
...Paulie. Stop now!	I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.	You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Owe you what?	You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.	Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.	Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!	Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.	Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?	He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
I don't like ya face.	Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.	Move your shoulders down.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.	No dollar.
This a con?	Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Cost ya a buck.	This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.	Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --	Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.	Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?	...Fine.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.	I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
I feel bad about walkin'.	Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Mr. Balboa --	Rocky.
Rocky, would you be interested in --	Sparrin'?
What?	Stuff it, man!
Listen, I hope ya don't --	I won't.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?	Yeah.
More like thirty.	Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Rice is a bum.	You think everybody I fight is a bum.
What's happened is freak luck.	Freak luck for sure.
Fifty years, huh.	Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
Please, kid.	Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.	Yo, Benny.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?	'Bout what?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.	Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.	Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?	My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --	Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.	Gazzo's gotta come to you.
...Maybe I better forget it.	Try again, c'mon, try again.
Why?	Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
I got whiskey here.	...No.
You ballin' her?	Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
To see ya train.	Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?	Feel? I dunno... Happy.
We don't serve formula. Snookums.	You serve martinis, doncha?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.	So where is it then?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?	He's a Toon... who cares?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?	Toon cops worked me over.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
So altruistic.	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?	Why didn't you tell me?
So where is it?	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Now what?	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
What the hell is that?	Doom.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.	So's the job.
When will I hear from you?	As soon as is humanly possible.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...	Sure, Valiant, sure...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
You tricked me, damn you!	Take it easy.
Aah!	Aah!
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
How do you know that?	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?	My brother.  Get inside.
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
What the hell are you doin' in there?	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
I think you oughta read it to her.	Good idea.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?	From this box here...
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.	I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.	Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!	The what?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.	Good-morrow, cousin.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Every man betake him to his legs.	But 'tis no wit to go.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.	Art thou hurt?
Uncle, 'tis a shame.	Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
It strains me past the compass of my wits.	If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.	The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.	Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.	She'll not come down tonight.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.	Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.	What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
[Within] Juliet!	I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
I have.	Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.	Amen
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!	Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.	Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.	Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.	More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Why, may one ask?	I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.	Well, what was yours?
Meaning, to court'sy.	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
I will follow you.	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.	I am for you.
Do you have it?	Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Of course.	Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.	So where do you go from here?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.	Which leads us to...
What is?	Best beer in the world known to man or God.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?	It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
Do I need to repeat myself?	No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
I still am.	Is that right?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.	I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Who are you?  IRA?	Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
It's quite satifactory.	Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Where's the case?	There's a problem...
And more importantly --	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.	But you hate each other!
Sent it where?	A post office box.
Gregor, is that you?	Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.	I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
A means to an end, is that it?	That's it.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.	Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
So what is it you want to know?	I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.	Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
It's been known to happen.	Why don't you go do better, then...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.	I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.	I don't think so.
Cigarette?	No thanks.
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?	Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.	I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
How did you know?	Know what?
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.	But you can't.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.	It's my job.
Do we need anything else?	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Not here.  They might see it.	If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.	Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Let's get him out of here...	Finish the job...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.	You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?	I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
What's the story?	It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.	Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.	I get the picture.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?	I can't get enough of it.
Ready to roll, partner?	Sure thing, and --
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?	The horniest dog in Nevada.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?	Maybe.  Who cares?
I've got one condition.	What's that?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?	He saw everything!
That's not what I mean.	Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
He would have done it to us, right?	Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.	Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
And how do you figure we do that?	All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
You're out of your mind.	Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You think he's bluffing?	No.
It's gonna be o.k.	Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?	It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?	Two thousand...
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.	Just take it in stride.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?	You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
How are ya?	Hello.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.	He's irresponsible.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...	I might have to look into that...
What's wrong?	Nothing.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?	You deserve it is the occasion.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...	Nothing happened?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.	There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...	It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I don't know, Booth.	I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
Why does that bother you?	I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?	I don't know.  My friends...
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.	I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?	You know I do.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...	A week ago, at most.
Test the product?	Yeah.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?	You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...	First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.	Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.	Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.	Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.	Did you say After Midnight?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.	So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Anything I can help you with?	Well I just uh, you know...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.	Anything...specific?
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.	Hmmm...
A lot of men come in here?	Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.	Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!	Take it or leave it.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?	Sort of.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?	I can't hear a word you're saying!
I'll settle for a third of that.	And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Oh Jesus Christ...	So I want the money and I want it now.
Don't hurt me.	We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?	Absolutely positively.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.	So someone did get away.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.	No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
You think he skipped town?	We're going to find out.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?	No, sir.
Winner six!	How much is that?
Invitation, please.	I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.	What??  Where'd you hear that?
How'd you know?	You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
So tell me what you know.	I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
What?	One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.	Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.	I don't think so.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?	I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...	So what's your story?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?	In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
You bring American money?	Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?	No.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.	Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Carter, get off that stage!	Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.	Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
What'd I say?	You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Hello.	How you doin'?
Goddamn you got a small ass.	Don't look at my ass!
Where are you going?	Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Not Yu.  You!	Who?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?	I'm okay, you go.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?	I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.	No.  She's a school teacher.
Who?	Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.	Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?	He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
He'll be back soon.	How do you know?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.	I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
No.  It was my singing.	Excuse me?
She's just standing around -- not doing much.	Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?	What's going on?
No.  It's not right.	Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
What's she doing?	Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.	Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?	What?
I wouldn't do that!!!	It's a bomb.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.	We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.	Mind your own business.
How was the sex?	There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Steamed dumplings?	Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.	Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.	A Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.	Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Ricky Tan is alive.	What?!?!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.	Carter...
What is this?	About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.	This money is evidence.
First class.	The Plaza Hotel?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?	Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
You move well.	Just trying to make it look real.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.	How do I know I can trust you?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?	No.  But I'll help you.
Master Ching taught me.	The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.	Any leads?
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.	The police can protect you.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.	Put the plates down.  It's over.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.	Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.	I know, Master, but...
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.	Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.	This is still Hong Kong.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.	Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.	I know, but --
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.	Carter.
You talk very fast.	Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.	I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!	I am not responsible for your assumptions.
-- what the hell is that?	What?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.	Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.	Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?	Stooly.
That's not how it goes.	Yes, I think so.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!	Yee-aww.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.	Good God, ya'll!
Are you OK?	I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
Want some?	No, fish is a PM food.
What?!	It's him.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.	I am from outa town.
Oh no.	What?
Oh my god. Griffin.	You know him?
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?	Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.	No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.	That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Any demands yet?	At this point we don't have much.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?	Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?	Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.	Nobody touches me.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?	Do it!
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.	How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Where do we find him?	You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Yes.	You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.	I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I am so sorry about your men.	Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
I will not have friends in America.	Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
You don't understand this guy.	Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.	Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What do you expect me to say to this?	How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
You look awful.	Thank you.
Really?	I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.	I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.	Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.	I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
-- It's for you, Ike.	What?
Maggie!	Where do you think she's going?
Or a vegetarian?	Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...	Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.	Unbelievable, she got to you.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...	Are you a reporter?
About her upcoming wedding and all.	No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?	Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --	-- The luau for Maggie.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.	You'll answer my questions?
Give me that!	But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.	He is not!
Too much.	Seven-fifty.
I'm a work in progress.	So?  Is that what you said to her?
I don't know.	You don't know.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.	Can you fix it?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.	Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
That was very interesting research George was doing!	What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.	Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?	I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Yes, you!	Well, you do have the dress.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?	I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.	It's something I've always wanted to do.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?	I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
You were not.	I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I'm listening.	"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.	It's probably because you got him fired.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.	On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".	No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!	No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.	I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Grandma!	See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.	No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
What are you talking about?	Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.	Yeah.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --	-- who's married to --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --	-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.	I love you.
Even when you were young?	Nope.  Not even when I was young.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?	How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
When you get back, I'll be gone --	And then I'll see you in New York --
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.	You couldn't.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.	Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
It's not true, but it feels true.	There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What's with you?	Nothing's with me.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.	Not.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --	"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
What?	I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."	Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 	You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
What?	Is this crazy?
I love you, too.	Good night.
But he saw you, right?	He said hello.
You don't know who she was, Annie --	I saw her.  She looked just like this --
This is a photo of hair.	Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Becky?	So I mailed your letter.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...	Okay.
No, I know that part --	So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --	A sense of humor.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.	Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --	I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?	Yes, I did.
It's probably just the flowers --	We'll move them --
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.	Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
You know.	What?
Magic.  It was magic.	Magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --	Mom, we already...
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...	Magic.
Hello.	Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.	I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
It's been about a year and a half.	Have you had any relationship since?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...	What's she talking about?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?	It's not that late in Seattle.
Is he home right now?	Yeah.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.	How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is not --	Right, right.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?	Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.	I don't think I have to now.
What?!	Nobody else is going to know it was us.
What?	I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?	Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.	It doesn't.  They ask you.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?	What do you think?
It was sinking.	What was?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.	You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --	There she is.
Did you call that radio station again?	No.
Everyone at work heard you.	I just called for a second.
Did too.	I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Yes?	You must be Jonah.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?	He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You saw her in the airport and then here?	I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.	Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Oh.	So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I read an article about this ...	I read the same article...
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!	Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?	There's nothing stopping you.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.	Whose side are you on anyway?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.	What do you mean -- sex equality?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.	So much the better.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.	He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
To the mine?	Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.	No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.	Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.	What's more important than sanitation?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.	I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!	All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?	If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Was it expensive, the beer?	Antonio paid for it.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.	I did forget. Luís told me.
What's the matter?	It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
A fighter, huh?	He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?	Yes.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?	I'm going back tomorrow.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.	Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
How do you feel?	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Where are you going?	Hunting.
When?	Sun up.
You mean you're ready to give up?	Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?	You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.	Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Go on. Spill it.	Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
No. New York.	New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?	I thought maybe you forgot...
Where's your mama?	She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...	The what!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...	You should have helped her without being asked.
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...	You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?	Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Bobby?	Shhh.
What can I do for you?	Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.	How about in the house?
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.	I understand. Thanks anyway.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.	I was thinking Alice Cooper.
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.	Colette ...
Go ahead.	Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
You don't understand.	There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Why don't you call the cops?	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?	Don't worry. He's out of town.
What do you want from me, Colette?	I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.	You don't like the tune, find another station.
What are you hiding, Danny?	Therapy session is over.
I'm kind of busy.	Please open the door, Danny.
We been through that.	What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.
How you holding up?	I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.	Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?	It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
How the hell did we get this detail?	Guess it's our turn.
Where to?	I know a guy.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?	Sorry.
What?	You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.	Can you set that up?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?	I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.	He doesn't have one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?	John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
What's this?	Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
What the hell is that?	It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
What?	I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
But... why? Why would you pretend?	I can't tell you.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.	I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.	You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.	Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.	Crank or glass?
Can we talk price?	Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?	I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.	Hey, okay.
You want to do this some other time?	Pull your pants down.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.	What?!
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.	What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
You don't find that repugnant?	Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.	This chink have a name?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?	Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Bullshit. He's a liar.	News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.	What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.
Danny?	My name is Tom.
This the guy?	It speaks!
Turns out he's connected.	To who?
The Mexicali Boys	And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.	What?!
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.	Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
He's the only one I told.	And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.	Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Excuse me?	Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?	They have. But they never found a lab.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.	What if he caps me before you can make a move?
When is the deal going down?	I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
You mean like the Donner Party?	Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Tom, quit fucking around.	Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.	That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
We're in business.	Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
What is that? Rum and coke?	Don't worry about it.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.	I thought you were done.
Yes, sir.	Where are your men now?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.	I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Sir?	There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
A private, sir?	He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
But, sir...I...I...	Spit it out, Captain.
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.	No kidding.
Yep.	You must be a hell a shot.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.	You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
He ain't Wade.	Nope, he ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.	Like hell, you did.
Where?	In the shadow by those two trees.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.	You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.	Good, now get your goddamned gear.
How about that jeep?	That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
That only leaves three.	Plenty.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.	Those guns are close.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.	But, sir...
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.	Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.	Since when have things been normal?
You think they'll be alright?	They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?	How about I go right, sir?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.	More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
You alright?	Let's just find someplace.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?	Bits and pieces.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?	It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Oh, yeah?	Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.	I think you're right, Keith.
What are we going to do?	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?	Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.	No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Captain, can I ask you a question?	Sure, Reiben.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.	Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.	You have orders, too.
Any further thoughts on the subject?	Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.	I don't like that one.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.	But we accomplish the mission.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.	See to it.
What deal?	I coach the baseball team, too.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.	Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.	As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Who cares?	I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.	We know.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Demolition, right?	Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
How fast?	Twenty-four-five.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.	We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
This evening is over.	And your former wife.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.	For going to school?
Thanks, I like yours too.	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
C'mon, just do it.	C'mon Lloyd.
Alright.	Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?	Read it.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.	If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I'll put this past my boss	Alright.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?	Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.	We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Morning honey.	Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.	Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.	You're going.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.	Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.	Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.	I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?	No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
Hello.	Hi.
Mom, please?	Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
This is me telling you about me.	You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?	Alright.
You will?	Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.	Yeah?
Yeah.	Yeah.
Well...	No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?	Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.	Goodbye.
So it's an honor?	No.
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
Thank-you.	I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Nobody knew me before tonight.	They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Sure I do.	Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...	Twisted?
Oh.	I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Me?  Sure I do.	Come on.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.	Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Yes.	What did you say?
Yeah.  With potential.	Friends with potential.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.	Right.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.	Oh.  I was putting the...
I don't know.  I'm happy.	Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
It did?	Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...	No, we don't have to say it.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.	No, I don't, I don't.
Yeah you do.	Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.	No I didn't.
You told your dad?	You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Then don't do it.	Oh shit.
You do?	Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.	I love you.
I'm fine.	Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Okay.	So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
You're freaking out here man.	You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.	Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
PAIN!	Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
The guy with the Datsun?	No.
The truck?	Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.	Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
What?	She's really pretty great, isn't she?
How ya doing?  Is she around?	Yeah.  Honey?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?	Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Seriously, Lloyd.	I'm totally and completely serious.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.	So what's up?
My car.	Your car?
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.	My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Ooop, excuse me.	How you doin', brother?
I was gonna...	Thanks a lot Lloyd.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?	I don't know.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.	Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Certainly.	I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I love you man	I love you too.
Oskar - my friend Lena.	How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Now you're back.	Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Well, let's find him.	He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.	My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
You know what, you'd like her.	Oskar, please -
It's not a charade, all this?	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.	I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.	I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.	Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.	He's important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.	I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
You took my workers.	They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
When?	I don't know.  Soon.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?	It's good business.
You're not telling me something.	It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
This is not my problem.	Look it up.
What do I got for you?	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?	Nice things cost money.
What's wrong with it?	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?	Wine?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?	The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.	Thank you.
I got to go, I'll see you.	Oskar -
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...	There will be generations because of what you did.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
We know that, son.	The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.	That doesn't work, sir.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.	I won't.
Don't. Think Bailey.	Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...	Stop it...
Hang up...call...	I'm losing you.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?	I'm inquisitive.
WHAAAATT?	Don't forget to set the alarm.
I don't think that's a good idea.	Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?	I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
It helped me realize one thing.	What?
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.	It’s over, Cotton.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.	Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Fair enough.	What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.	And much richer as a result.
Hi, Gale, any leads?	Tons and tons.
What are you going to do?	Finish what my son started.
But you’ll never get away with it.	Enter Cotton Weary.
No way.	Yeah.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.	Sid, you don't have to.
Lemme take you home.	I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.	It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Two.	So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
He sent me the cutest e-mail.	I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You’re the one who got away.	Until now.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?	The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...	And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
We had to have financing.	Tuition’s expensive.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...	I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.	I see you read the book.
You have every right to be upset.	Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.	I think you're all an act.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?	Meaning?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?	Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
You broke my heart.	What are we looking for?
And it's sexier in the dark.	Dewey, you and I would never make it.
This is all too familiar.	Over here.
Let's go.	No, wait here.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.	No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.	Don't worry...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?	It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?	Please, I have the perfect excuse.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.	I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.	I'd really just like to be alone.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.	It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.	Her old boyfriend?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.	Thanks, Joel.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.	But...
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...	..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Hello?	Gale?
Take it off.	But...
You ass.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I'll be right back.	Where you going?
What do you want?	I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Do you work for her now?	Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.	And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
What do you mean?	I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.	I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.	Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.	I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.	Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Please, call me Gale.	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.	To me Hollywood is about death.
What do you mean?	I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.	Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.	Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.	What does this have to do with Sid?
Is that a threat, Detective?	When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Detective Kincaid?	What Rielly?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?	He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.	And what made you think it was Sidney?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.	Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?	Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.	And?
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.	Someone stole Sid's file?
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.	Do you want us to come with you?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.	Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
Geez.	What the hell are you doing?
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?	Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Just because you knew her?	Yeah.
But you know my favorite name?	I'm hanging up right now.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.	SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.	Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?	W-what do you want?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.	You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.	Who is this?
Hello?	Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
No I need to call you. Just you.	I'm sorry, your voice.
How'd you do?	Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Dude. What are you doing here?	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.	It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
You rode your bike out there?	Yes, sir.
Billy? What the...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Close call.	What are you doing here?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...	Oh Sidney...
You heard me.	Are you serious?
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
I don't understand...	We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
I don't know.	You have to have a favorite.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?	Guess.
I have to go now.	Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Nah, I don't think so...	Don't hang up on me.
What's his name?	I can't think.
...please... no...	Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
...leave me alone... please...	Answer the question and I will.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.	You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.	Mind if I join you?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.	I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Does mom know?	Yes, you doofus.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.	I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.	Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Should I be worried?	Not yet.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.	How is everything?
I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?
She's tough.	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.	She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Where is she?	Call the police.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.	The phone's dead.
Where is she?	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.	But it's so much easier when we make it up.
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.	Have you talked to Cotton?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.	He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Where do you get this shit?	Ricki Lake.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.	Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.	What's your favorite scary movie?
Are you alone in the house?	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.	If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.	Who are you?
Have a good trip.	Sleep tight, sweetie.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.	Twice.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?	What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
You coming tonight?	Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
So what's his reason?	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.	Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.	I can cry on cue.
Yeah.	I'll be right back.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.	You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.	Why are you doing this?
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.	Do they know who did it?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...	They think it's school-related?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.	I'll be there by seven. I promise
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Do you really think Billy did it?	He was there, Tatum.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...
What do you think about when you're having sex?	With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
No way.	Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
TATUM!	Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
You don't.  It goes to court now.	He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...	So what?  This victim...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.	This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.	I heard.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.	He's not finished.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
I don't believe it.	Hello.
What time is it?	Why?
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
Where we headed?	You'll see.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?	Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.	You know that's not true.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?	Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.	You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
You should be thanking me.	And, why is that?
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.	Sit back.
I... I don't follow.	All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.	Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.	I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.	Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
Well?	I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"	I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.	All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
No fingerprints?	Nothing.
What the fuck is that?	A switchblade.
He just may be nuts enough.	It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...	Oh, that's all.
Does this make it with you?	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?	Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.	Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.	No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...	No.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.	No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?	Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.	What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.	How is this legal?
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.	Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
This is a waste of time.	We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.	The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
Wait... just wait.	It was him.
Think about it...	What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a...	No point in arguing anymore...
He's preaching.	These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.	You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?	You do your job...
Where's the victory?	You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?	It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.	Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.	That part of me is dead.
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.	When do we get to question him?
You know he's fucking us.	You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
Well... what the fuck, man?	He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.	I will.
Throw your gun down now!	What are you talking about?  What happened?
Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this...
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.	I... I don't understand.
Anything... anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?	I can't do this now... please.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.	It surprises me.  It really does.
Perfect example.	You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
I don't know why I asked you to come.	Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.	You should look into private schools.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.	I hate this city.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.	Crime of passion.
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.	It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?	Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!	That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?	Huh...? No...no water.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?	I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
What good does that do?	By what you preach...none!
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...	...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
You got any more orders, Captain?	Just keep goin'...
I didn't give any order to fire!	That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.	Now mount up, son...
I say NO!	Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
What in...?	Captain Clayton...Captain!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??	Sir?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?	Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
If there's anything I can do, sir...	God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.	Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...	But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Unnt-meah!	We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
Ay-eh...They was here...	SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...	Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...	Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
I beg your pardon?	That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Yes, sir.	Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...	Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?	Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...	I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Why?	Because she's my...my...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!	I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...	What's that?
Futterman?	He just couldn't wait...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.	But I just bought a good blanket.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!	Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...	Cut it out, will ya...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.	Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Well, you're a widower now...	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
They'll be back...	We won't be here...Come on!
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...	You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Comancheros...	That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.	I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?	No...not yet...
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...	From the beginning...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...	You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.	You crazy?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...	I got to fetch her home...
I have to cut his windpipe...	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Maybe the antenna's broken.	We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!	Do you have a better idea?
Cherry-red Tears.	What?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?	Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.	We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.	'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
It's important - he knows the last chapter.	Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.	Thank you.
No, I've never seen him before.	You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
And that is?	A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Mrs. Straub!	I've killed my husband!
What?	I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
Oh…what have I done?	He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Follow that boat!	Right you are, governor!
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.	Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?	Ask him.
We have no Juliet!	No Juliet?!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?	When I have fifty pounds.
Are you writing?	A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
How much?	Ten pounds.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.	Ned is wrong for it.
No, your marriage bed.	Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
This time we take your boots off!	What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
But nothing is happening.	Yes, but very well.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.	Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
What happened to Sam?	Who are you?
Do you know it?	Every word.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?	Fifty pounds? What for?
I feel a scene coming on.	Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Will! Have you finished?	Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?	I did not.
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.
How will it?	I don't know, it's a mystery.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.	How will it?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.	I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.	Yes, that's good. Until he meets
The daughter of his enemy.	The daughter of his enemy.
As a nurse.	But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
But your voice  Have they dropped?	No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"	"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I would not for the world!	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
Like you, I found him not at home!	So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.	Oh. What is your name?
No…no.	But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."	"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
My lady Viola.	My lord.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .	But why me?
I understand of course. It is to be expected.	It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Like a sickness and its cure together.	Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
But what of Lord Wessex?	For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
"Poet?"	I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.	Serve.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.	Will you shut up and play.
Only on expenses.	It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Alex, I don't have the time --	Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
You mean immoral.	I'm only asking you both to think about it.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.	But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
No, not that.	Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.	Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.	We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I won't be able to.	You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I don't know.	Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
How much?	I don't know.
What is this?	Security.
I want to secure it.	Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Who?	Your friends.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.	Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.	It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?	Yeah?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --	Where do you think you'll go?
What?	I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.	I don't know anything about it.
Well?	But there's no --
Are you recording it?	What does it look like?
Well, is it?	What?
That's right.	What?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?	Yes, thanks.
Cameron.	Cameron?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?	Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Did you know --	Just serve.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.	She hated you --
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.	He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
You want me to kick it open?	Yes.
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
I don't thinkI can.	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Sshh.	I want my money back. Excuse me.
Love and happiness for ever.	For ever and ever.
Hello. Hello.	Who was it?
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	It tastes different.
We have to talk.	Your painful groin?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --	Oh, good.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.	And the money?
It makes us feel a whole lot better.	That's what I thought he said.
Interesting.	I see.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.	did you hear anything before he cries?
No, nothing, sorry.	Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.	And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
I've never seen a dead body before.	Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?	I'm sorry.
Two hundred.	Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.	You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.	No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
What do we do here, David?	Sorry?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?	Not any real sneering as such, no.
What guy?	That guy, the one that died.
Oh, him. Well, he died.	That's what I thought.
You must be Hugo.	You must be Juliet.
What do you do?	Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Working nights?	I'm a doctor.
Same as everyone else.	But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Diseases.	Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Both, sir.	Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Offering it for debate.	It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Your watch.	Is it real?
You're in a good mood today, George.	Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Do you think George is a fairy?	Who?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?	Yes, but... I thought...
That's George.	It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --	Lester, don't you think that uhh --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --	-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- is that what this is all about?	Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.	I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Why not?	I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
I know.	Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
Nummers.	What?
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.	What kind of treatment?
No, I know.	And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Comb my hair out later, honey.	No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Then it's not your problem.	It isn't?
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.	Okay.
You here to see my mother?	Yeah.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?	No thanks.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.	Why do you wanna know so bad?
I asked you first.	Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Yeah, it is.	I never get my hair done.
No shit.	You think that's funny, don't you?
You are.	I am not!
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.	Right.
Wonderful woman.	She is.
I went to school with her husband.	Great.
You do know what money's like these days.	Well, yeah... you know.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.	Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.	Buffums?
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.
Well, what do you think?	I'd cut it...
... I don't get it done often.	Whew.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.	Yeah... wow.
Not too much, don't cut too much.	Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
Why not?	... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
George...	Yeah, baby...
Don't do it.	That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
That sounds like me.	I am you, you little bastard.
-- what?	Nothing.
What's wrong?	-- do you want ice?
Why?	Lester's on his way.
Look about last night --	Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
-- Right after I sprayed her?	What?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.	-- Oh yeah.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?	Otis is dead.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...	-- oh -- sweetheart...
Jackie Shawn.	-- yeah, this is --
Not yet.	Okay... thanks...
I have to see you.	Hey, stop by the shop.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.	No shit?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.	What?
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.	Honey, what happened?
You're different.	I am?
Honey?	Yeah, baby.
Maybe you don't even like children.	Of course I like children.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...	Okay, baby. Okay...
I already said hello.	Okay.
George.	Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?	Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
When is that?	I'll call you.
Never mind. Where've you been?	A business meeting, I told you that.
I know, honey.	Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Bullshit.	I do, Jill.
Well that's something.	What is.
You did fuck him, didn't you?	I'm very tired, George.
Didn't you, baby?	Let go of me.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.	Oh, Christ.
-- and take this with you.	Where did this come from?
I wish you'd go now.	That's all you've got to say?
Please!... that's not like you.	Yeah, I know. Did you?
Stop it.	Did you?
It's good you want to do something, George.	Thank you.
Tonight?	Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?	Isn't that bad for it?
Godammit, George...	Now wait a minute...
Sit down.	But...
I wanna hear about it.	Oh Jesus Christ.
Was it me, did you have something against me?	What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?	Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!	... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.	We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.	I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
You're home.	Yeah.
I'm coming over.	I'll call you back.
No you won't.	What do you mean?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.	Okay.
	Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.	You do?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.	Is that right?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.	George is going to open a shop.
Who were you talking to?	Who do you think I was talking to?
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.	So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...	Really? How about starting with tonight?
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?	Fine.
No.	Why not?
That's right.	I'll call you.
I am? I mean why?	Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.	I know, I'm sorry.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?	Don't be silly.
It's been so long I don't how long?	Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
What?	I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.	-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...	Didn't you have any panties on?
Oh. thank you.	Sure.
Good for you.	He's a hairdresser.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --	-- oh I don't know --
Thank you.	-- just wonderful.
Everything okay, son?	Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.	What was the Donner party?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.	You mean they ate each other up?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Come here for a minute, first.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.	Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.	Do they know he tell you things?
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.	What about Room 237?
No I ain't.	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Yeah.	Danny, come on over here.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?	No.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?	Okay, Mom.
Red Rum.	Are you having a bad dream?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Mommy...	Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!	Danny!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?	Yes.
Please...	Thank you.
But eh what was the matter with him?	Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.	Well how can I repay you?
Grady?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.	And, er... where are they now?
Who?	A nigger.
How?	Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.	Grady... oh.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.	Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Good evening.  Forest Service.	Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.	Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.	It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Beg pardon?	Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?	Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?	Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?	Yes.
I don't know.	I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Yes...	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!  Please...	Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.	Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stay... stay away!	Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.	Go away.
I'm gonna go now.	Wendy...
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.	Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Only in a very general way.	Well...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.	Well, that sounds fine to me.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?	They'll love it.
I don't believe they did.	Well, my predecessor in this job
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are	shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, obviously some people can be	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.	Well, it's very... homely.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.	Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Can I tell you kids something?	Sure, Uncle Al.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Went shopping. Why?	Jane, I have to talk to you.
Please, Uncle Al.	Will you?
Are you all right, Marty?	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
I've been hearing noises in there.	What kind of noises?
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?	No.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Don't call me dear boy.	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.	I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?	Sure.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.	Yeah, I know. It's great!
Was it a prescription?	What the hell does that matter?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.	I told you!
It could have been anything, Marty.	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I saw what I saw.	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.	Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.	Really?
I think I hear it!	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
But I'm fearful!	SING!
And I'm tearful!	SING!
How are you doing.	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?	What did who say?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.	You did what?
What? 	You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!	You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!	That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
This prom is a real drag.	Oh-huh.
Look at that.  Get a gander.	Oh my! 
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...	Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.	D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.	But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Hold on.	Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Two days.  An hour or so.	No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."	So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
What is it, Mary?	That man -- who is he?
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE	What a shame!
Soprano or alto?	Whatever.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.	That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
JUST SING!	Sing!
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?	Three years.  Sister.
We need experience.	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Oh my Lord!	Experience!
I don't want to mess anyone up...	Give me a C.  A C!
Are you leaving us?	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Run!  Take off!	Again?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME	What did He say?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.	Enough joking.
St. Anne's?	Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.	Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.	You mean black people?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"	Would you like that?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.	Can do.
No!  No!  I can't do this!	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...	No problem.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.	Silence?  No talking?  All day?
What's wrong with my life?	From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.	Mary Clarence!
Sometimes it's not enough!	You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
It never solves anything.	Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.	But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.	What do you mean?
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?	I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
You sent for me?	You have a phone call.
What?	I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.	Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
You saved my life.	I'm a Christian.
So I don't shop.	'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
He's a businessman.	A what? When are you qonna wake up?
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?	Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!	You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
And if I don't?	Then-you run.
Ten flights?	You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!	Get a stenographer.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.	Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.	You're supposed to be hiding out!
Really?  Lieutenant?	I've been worried about you.
You're not... seeing anybody?	No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
I have?	You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
I can't go with you.	What?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?	You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.	Oh-huh.
Where's who?	You won't even tell us?
We're looking for Mike.	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Get her!	Which one!
I can't see anything in here!	Willy -- hit the lights.
Joey?	Where is she?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.	That should have tipped us.
Yes, Mary Patrick?	Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Peace on Earth.	However, we can also pray for other things.
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!	She's our inspiration!
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
But, Bishop...	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.	And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?	Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
We must be a curious sight to him.	What are you spying on?
You need to sleep.	Bring him.
It is sacrilege!	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.	No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...	I am the Lord's voice in this town.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.	You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?	When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Listen to what you say....	No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Where are we going?	Up.
Are you familiar with magnets?	What kind of nuts?
Thank you.	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.	Father said witches live there.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.	And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?	Baltus Van Tassel.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.	There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I was getting worried.  Who was it?	Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?	Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What now?  Where is she?	Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 	I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
This is farewell.	Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
He has proposed to me twice.	Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.	There is no such thing as magic.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?	May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...	You made this, and the drawings?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.	That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
You promised justice.	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
Why would you do such a thing?	No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.	You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?	She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
My God... what has happened?	He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Ichabod...	Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?	I can show exactly.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.	No one will believe your lies, whore.
Go home.	May I see my mother?
She is guilty.	No, sir, please... she is innocent...
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.	Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.	See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.	Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Well, I guess it's all good.	What do you like to eat here?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.	They was a boy. We made friends.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.	Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.	See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.	I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.	This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.	What do you want, hun?
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.	I get nervous, that's all I know.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?	Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.	Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
What's in your bag?	This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.	How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.	I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
But maybe just for awhile --	I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Why'd you live there?	I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Do you like to play football?	I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.	I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.	You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Where'd you get them flowers?	That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.	All right then.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.	All right then.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.	If you want me to.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.	He ain't no count.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?	Naw.
So it died when it come out?	My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A boy or girl?	A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?	I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.	Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.	Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?	I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.	I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
Yeah, I guess.	Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.	You don't want to give away all your books.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.	Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.	Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
You walk fast, don't you?	I reckon.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.	Me, too.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.	I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.	You better go get your things.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?	Naw.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?	Yes sir.
Do they know about you?	My history.
I'll be.	That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?	No ma'am.
Thank ye.	It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?	Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?	I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Yeah.	You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.	You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?	I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Do you have family here?	Not really to speak of.
Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?
He just got out of the state hospital.	I know.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.	Signs?
Yes.	I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?	I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge. 
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?	I confess.
And your father? Is he from New York?	Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?	Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Not an easy book.	Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.	Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
What about for you?	For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?	What's that, Sol?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."	What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.	Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Are you closed?	You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.	Yeah, I did.
A photographer ...	Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.	It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
I've never seen anything like it.	It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?	He's crazy.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.	We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hey, man, how's it going?	Hi, Auggie.
Two, right?	Uh, better make it one.
You usually get two.	Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.	Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
I'm all ears.	Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.	I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.	Anything for art, eh, Paul?
What do you mean?	I mean, it's a good story.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?	Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?	I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?	Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?	Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.	Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?	It means "happiness."
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.	It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.	And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Still, you can't just write her off.	Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.	Bully for you.
What's this?	Why don't you open it and find out?
For keeps?	For keeps.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?	I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.	Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
A little. Not much.	This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Open it.	What is this, some kind of joke?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.	You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?	Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.	I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.	Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Benefits?	You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.	An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
You named the kid after yourself, huh?	That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.	Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.	I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.	Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
East Seventy-fourth Street.	In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?	Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?	Nice drawing. Did you do that?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.	Is your father an artist?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?	Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?	I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?	No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 	Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 	Take good care of yourself, okay?
Where the hell do you think you're going?	Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Let's not get too idealistic.	Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Celebrate? What for?	It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?	I just did.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?	Absolutely. We would be honored.
Good thinking.	That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.	That's it. In a nutshell.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.	That money is my whole future.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?	It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
No wonder he was angry.	He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.	Good. I'm glad that's settled!
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.	It's all right. I really do know them.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.	Now ask him who his mother was.
I don't know.	You don't.
Why?  If they could never take title.	Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?	It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?	Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...	No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.	All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?	Well, what if?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.	Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.	But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...	I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...	It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.	I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.	Those aren't the facts that matter.
Well, what then, sergeant?	What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.	Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?	Pretty darn clear.
Did you say more?	I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?	My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Greedy.	He didn't want to lose any more.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...	That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.	That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?	Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.	Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.	I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.	Yes.
I did.  Boy.	Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.	Won't take two.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.	To my father.  Everything counts.
That's when he fell.	Fell.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.	Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.	But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?	The knife.  What knife?
Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...	Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
You wouldn't even see it move.	You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?	Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?	Apparently.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?	Possible.  But not darn likely.
Well...	Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
For certain, no.	But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Can I say something, here?	Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...	Such as?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.	Bye.
Wanna see my driver's license?	Get lost, will you?
I beg your pardon.	All right, girls - from the top again.
Upsy-daisy.	Fresh!
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?	
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?	A what?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 	What did he say?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -	How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
We're not?	First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?	He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.	Quiet - I'm thinking.
Nellie told us about it.	We're not too late, are we?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...	Knock it off, will you?
Where are we running, Joe?	As far away as possible.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?	Shave our legs, stupid.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?	Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.	Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
DAPHNE?	I never did like the name Geraldine.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -	Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
What are you doing?	I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -	It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
What happened?	I got pinched in the elevator.
Me?  After Sugar?	I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.	Don't get burned, Daphne.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?	Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
And where's he going to be?	He's going to be ashore with you.
What are you doing with my flowers?	I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?	Have I got things to tell you!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?	Security.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?	Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Hey - these are real diamonds.	Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.	So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
What are you giving me with the omelette?	Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?	What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?	Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
OH!	Terribly sorry.
She sings, too.	I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
Are my seams straight?	I'll say.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.	If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
And that's one of them.	Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.	We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'm not crowding you, am I?	No.  It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?	No, no.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.	You got some?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.	I may spill something.
Here you are, Sugar.	A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
What do you think you're doing?	Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.	Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
His yacht?	It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.	Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
No!	Yes.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.	I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
What for?	And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?	Yes.  For a whole year.
It's about the Florida job.	The Florida job?
What's wrong with us?	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
We could pass for that.	- you got to be blonde -
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.
Let me carry one of the instruments.	Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.	You don't say.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.	Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?	Bull fiddle.
You must be quite a girl.	Wanna bet?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.	Why?
Please.  It won't happen again.	No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Another bridesmaid?	Flower girl.
We can have it altered.	Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
It doesn't matter.	And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?	We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Anything today?	Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You're making it up pretty good so far.	The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
What's the job?	It's three weeks in Florida -
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?	It's not the backs that worry me.
What kind of band is this, anyway?	You got to be under twenty-five -
No, we couldn't!	William Morris!
We got time off for good behavior.	There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.	Where did he conduct?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.	No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Bingo?	You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
That so?	Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.	But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Men!	So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.	What's in Florida?
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?	Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Why not?	Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.	She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
That must be it.	Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.	For your own amusement?
Well, I guess I'd better go -	It's been delightful meeting you both.
The most wonderful thing happened -	What?
Three?	Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Oh - in here.	Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.	It's all right for a bachelor.
What is it?	Oh - a member of the herring family.
Look at all that silverware.	Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?	I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Harmless - how?	Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
I don't want to bore you.	Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?	How can you think about food at a time like this?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?	All right - if you insist.
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.	Lets throw another log on the fire.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?	Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Really?	From a rich millionaire.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?	Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?	According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?	Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -	That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Good evening, sir.	I come to the old lady's funeral.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...	Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.	Who's going to raid a funeral?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!	Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.	Big joke!
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.	What for?
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?	Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?	Bacardi 151.
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.	What? Why? What do you mean?
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.	What for?
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?	Actually, I do.
Say something. Please.	I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Where’s Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.
What’s going on with you two?	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.	Mom, please.
You heading to the train station?	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.	No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.	Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Hey, you!	Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
I’m sorry?	I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?	I don’t know.
Six thousand, right?	On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
Who are they?	Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.	That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Would you grab my shampoo?	Shampoo, got it!
Yes.	What?!
Subtle?	I disappear. It’s not about me.
Is this for last night?	Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	It’s my job.
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?	I didn’t say he was worth it.
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.	Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.	Hi.
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?	Give it back? Are you nuts?
So why’d you let him go?	It’s complicated, Dad.
“Not yet...”	“...but it’s getting there. “
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?	Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--	--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?	Will do.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.	Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?	David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!	I try...
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?	Sure--
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!	What do that mean?
Go on...	Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...	:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.	:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
But, Charlie --	NO! N-O, NO!
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.	Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?	Yes, sir...
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--	"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?	I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?	Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Son, that was some trip you went on...	Where was you, Daddy?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!	We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!	I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Mornin', son...	Mornin', Daddy...
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...	September 4 -- how far away is that?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.	My father taught me...
Miss Boatwright --	Yes, David...
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!	That's right!
Who's winning, Mama?	Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?	Same as we -- they pray.
'Bye, Mama...	'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
What is it, David Lee?	Listen, Mama...
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!	Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Can I go day after tomorrow?	Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?	Yes, mam...
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.	Did you find your father?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.	I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
What's wrong with him, David?	It's the heat.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.	He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.	Come in, children.
Come, I'll take you home.	I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.	I'm used to it.
Is he gon' be gone long?	Might be...
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.	I wanta get some things.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--	I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Whatcha wanta order?	I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
You ready to eat?	I'll wait till after the children.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.	Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.	I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.	You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!	Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.	Pillow.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-	OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?	Fragile?
-no Cheesy Poofs.	-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!	Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.	Sheet!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?	'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
I can't believe he's dead.	Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.	Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
You're late, Cartman!	I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?	I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Mom...	Yes, hon?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!	I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...	I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
You've got a stupid accent too.	Eric, that is not appropriate.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?	Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Thank God, that sucked ass.	Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
What's going on, Chef?	Something big, children.
Viva la Resistance.	Oh no, it's that kid.
Purpre mama!	Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?	Uhh...
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.	Mrph mprph!!
Who is it?	Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Guess.	Uhh... Bacon.
SHIT!	FREEZE!!
That's gonna take a long time!	Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
That was sweet!	Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!	Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!	Our moms suck!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!	How do we do that?
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!	Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!	Wow!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?	No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
I thought you had something planned.	Me?!
Oh dear God...	What is 'fisting'?
Oh Lord, what have we done...?	Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!	Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
I am the dark master!	Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!	Oh.
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!	Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?	Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.	I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!	Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
It's from your mother.	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
You'd fuck your uncle!	YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Fight the power!	The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.	Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Oh, you are such a maroon!	You would know, dummy.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.	I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.	I know, Terrance. I know.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.	Hey, come here, guy.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!	Don't call me dumb!
What if I just left?	Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?	Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Hi Wendy.	Hi Stan.
NAZIS!!	What's the matter, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.	God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Check.	And the butfor?
Oh my God, what is he doing?	He's shutting off the air!!!
Evening.	It can't be.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.	Of course, of course...
So...	Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.	Very professional of you.
Weren't you down in the dining room?	I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?	Well it's a good thing that I did.
You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.	Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
You want to go back to shuttle work?	It's steady, good benefits.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.	Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?	Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?	You better start making sense!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.	We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
I don't know what you're talking about!	Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Is that clear?	That's clear.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.	Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Look at this...Jesus.	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.	Like that piece of ass he was with.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.	Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.	That's right.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?	Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
He certainly is polite.	Close every door behind you!
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Explosive?	One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Do you want some advice?	Sure.
Dawn!  Dawn!	Helllp!
Take this flare.	A flare?  A flare won't do it.
And what are you going to do?!	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.	I'm about to blow the wall.
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
So close...	And so far.
In that case, I accept.	Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
No, just enjoying the view.	Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.	Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Where's Taylor?	He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?	Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Well now what are we gonna do!	How am I supposed to know?
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!	Talk to him...Jesus...
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.	That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.	Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
How is it looking, Mac?	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?
I hate fuckin' opera.	How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.	It was a clearance.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.	Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.	Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
What's on your mind, Miles?	We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.	Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.	I'm sure you have Buzz.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.	They suspended me for 100 years.
What do you think I can do?	I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.	Don't say that about my mom!
The whole world thinks you're underground.	I am underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.	I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
What about bowling?	Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.	See ya 'round Maynard.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!	Clam it!
He's the guy Buzz.	He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.	Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -	SHEILA!
I have someone for you to play with Junior.	Someone wants to play with me?
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.	If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.	No!
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.	You know who I am?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.	What ever happened to just bowling?
Where's Junior?	He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
After we eat, Dad.	He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Don't go near the bowling alley.	Bowling "Center"!
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.	She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!	Yippy!
Whoa.	It's a vicious cycle.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.	The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?	I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?	Not while I'm in training.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?	Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.	So, what about you?
Do I want you?	We'll get into that later.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.	No, I'm fascinated.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?	Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?	Plan B is your dad.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.	He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?	What's plan C?
Do you talk with your mom?	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
Come on, bargain with me.	I could let them go for ten.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.	If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?	Why should I help that old fuck.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?	You got any broken bones?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.	Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I can't tell you, Theo.	Why not?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.	Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.	Did you - kill him?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.	I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?	I'm looking for somebody.
You guys got something going on downstairs?	We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!	Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.	Dwarf bowling's illegal.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.	Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.	Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!	Please, Dr. Levine.
Get out of there!	I can't see...
How big is this spacecraft?	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
In basic English, what does all this mean?	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.	Forty yards.
Thirty yards.	What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Don't do it!	Now!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.	Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.	Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --	-- Wait a second --
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.	ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.	But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.	You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
What for?	If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
You think he killed Edmunds?	Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
It's not sucking, sir.	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
What caused it?	Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --	Harry?  Can you copy?
Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.	In a minute, sir.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.	What?
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.	The what?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.	We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.	What's the message?
What?	He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Some sort of lead or something.	Radiation shield, you think?
What's wrong?	What do you make of this?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
They switched us over.	To what?
From the sphere?	What's inside the sphere.
What is that?	The sensors are picking up something outside.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?	What was Edmunds doing outside?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?	We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Where'd this come from?	The library.
Yeah, it was awful.	What about you?  What happened to you?
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?	Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Wait a minute.	What?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?	Yeah, why?
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."	Where did you get this?
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?
It's not worth the risk.	It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You fixed my suit?	You don't trust me?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?	I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
None of this was here before.	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.	You think?
He translated it wrong.	What?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.	But how?
I don't know.	How can the sphere do that?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.	Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Diphenyl parlene.	Something for burns.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.	Bingo.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?	Antibiotic.
What's that?	Causes sleep.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
How do you feel about snakes?	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.	You tell me.
Did you?	What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.	No, he isn't.
You're lying --	Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.	Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Beth!	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Beth, stop it!	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Beth?	Leave me alone, Norman.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.	Beth -- gimme the gun.
You hear that?	Hear what?
How's that?	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?	All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.	We never even had a conversation, Norman.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Just in time, too.	In time for what?
When did it come across?	Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?
C'mon, Norman.	Look, would you --
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
I can't believe that, Harry.	Gimme another explanation.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.	Am I?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?	Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Norman, where are you?	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Beth left?	I thought she was with you.
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
Fine.	Help me lift her.
Missed.	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Well, press something!	Wait!
There is one possibility.	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?	You mean forget?
Well, if it's a discharge --	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.	It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Norman Johnson.	Does this mean what I think it means?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.	What report?
You mean they haven't told you yet?	Told me what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.	You mean a picture?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --	Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?	He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I think there are some things we should talk about.	I'm beginning not to like you.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.	I know that.
You saw through me?	You could put it that way.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Are you all right?	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Of course, where you been kid?	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Should we alert the Sith Lords?	I'll make a report later.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Is he afraid of the water?	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.	Who is this?  What's your operating...
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
You rich kids... are all the same !	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Whad'ya talkin  about ?	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
No, this hurts.	YAAAAAAAA !
Mobile Infantery rules !	Death to all bugs !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.	In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.	Your father will never let you.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Profile's wrong... there.	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.	You and me, huh ?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.	Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Carmen...?	Excuse me...!
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.	You're upset, that's alright.
She's flying starships !	Who ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...	Excuse me...!
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
None at all... We won.	Good luck at the academy.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...	Who cares ?
I love you, Carmen.	Shhh...
You're late.	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.	I like it. It's kinda...you.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Where'd it come from ?	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
You still gonna play for Brazil ?	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !	Teenagers !
...CUT OFF !	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.	Oh, is that how it is ?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...	I won't quit !
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.	Keep trying, Sergeant.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !	Sir, thank you, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?	Sir, yes it is, sir.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?	Here in Buenos Aires.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...	Aw, don't get mushy.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!	Hi, mom.
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Can you walk ?	Not a problem.
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?	Uh, I don't know.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...	We're not leaving you here, sir !
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.	That is how V'ger will survive.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?	By the Creator.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Stop competing with me, Decker!	Permission to speak freely, sir?
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
<U>Computer off</U>!	It's taken control of the computer...!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...	This served the purpose.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Was he difficult?	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Mr. Spock?	Impact in fifteen seconds...
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.	Any reply from them?
They had a pattern to follow...	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           	The point... 
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Why aren't you on board?	Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Then you'll be wet.	I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
He have any special dietary requirements...?	He'll eat potroast and like it.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?	I need a typewritter.
I want to rent this one.	Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I quit.	You quit.
Why?	It's about life.
You get what you pay for.	That's true.  You grow up here?
But, but but but...	No, no, I see...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...	Of course.
Goodbye.	Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...	Surest thing you know.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...	...I always thought so...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?	You're still here.
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...	What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?	Yes.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."	Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
...lost the screw...	You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?	Paperclip?
Hi.	You going to ask me in?
Thank you.	Read the card.
Start?  This isn't a good time.	Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?	Sure did.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?	I can't get it to come out right.
What's the scene...	It used to be the Old Mill.
That's right...	...take <u>any</u> two people...
Where you going?	Going home.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...	What?
No, that's true.	No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Pelting down out there.	People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
What am I gonna do?	You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...	But that's what happened.
Drama Group?	Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...	Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What, what what are you doing here?	Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.	That's so beautiful...
We did...?	Where have you been...
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.	Well, then, what's he doing here?
Mornin', Doc...	You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
They're holding it for ransom.	Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
What's an Associate Producer credit?	It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
It'll hurt the box office.	They know what her tits look like.
He's on the ph...	Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...	I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?	And I need a drink.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.	Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
...why am I here...?	What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Waterford, Vermont.	...you got to get me that street for nothing...
How big is this horse?	Fifteen hands.
They think it's your First Wife...	That Could Be.
Mornin, sister.	We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?	Sure, what have you got?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?	...not if you've got something to hold on to.
She's a <u>waitress</u>.	What...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?	You mind...?
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...	Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Izzat so?	The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?	Mr. Bailey.
No.	Then what is the...?
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?	I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
Get him on the phone.	He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
That's my...	Oh.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."	Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...	Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...I can't do it, Wally...	Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...	I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Hello.	...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...	Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.	Marty...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."	I'll put the, in your r...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?	Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
You show Claire these sketches?	Yes.
Kiss my ass.	Well.
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?	Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?	This young woman.
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...	...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.	He told you that...
He didn't have to tell...	I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
And what was it you wanted to say?	Gut Yuntif.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...	You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?	You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
He saw the accident...?	Sure.
I'm very sorry I...	You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Not now.	My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?	Did you, where are we going tonight...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...	You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?	I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Grace...	That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I want to make a good film.	I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...	Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
What's the...	Where have you been...?
I've got a date.	He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I treated you like a son or nephew.	It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...	The girl was in the car.
<u>Siddown</u>!	I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
You can't write it?	I can write it.  I can't type it.
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...	The breasts symbolize motherhood...
How do they know that, you told them?	No.
It's lovely.	A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
You cool the broad out?	I left that for you.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...	What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
<u>Stop</u>...	That's what I said.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?	She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.	He's got a gift for fiction.
Mmm.	That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...	I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?	Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...	So we just got lucky.
Zat true?	Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;	I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
Ben!  What's wrong?	I killed her!
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.	Excellent point.
Well, not exactly s...	Why does Rachel scream?
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...	...why do you think?
I hope it's the right kind.	Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.	I bet.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...	Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
I said...	...I'm not deaf, y'know.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...	And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.	I'm not.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.	Until he's old enough to read.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.	I'll miss you so much.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --	This is my daddy's house --
The timing was off -- I need this light.	<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!	But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
What if he's kidnapped?	He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.	See, I...
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.	Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.	Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...	Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Great.  Big ears, too?	No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
You do NOT run out on your moth...	YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.	No.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --	No!
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!	No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!	Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Queen of diamonds.	Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?	Yes.
Mommy's sick, guys.	You have the WORST flu since...
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.	Is your bad?
Okay.  These are good.	I helped.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...	Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!	No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Called him.  We set an ap...	Don't do this.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.	Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...	<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
Still, please.	Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.	No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.	Stop.  You're making me insecure.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.	This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
We don't have any coffee.	What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
What did you do?	Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...	...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
Get out!	But it's not on the schedule!
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...	You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I need practice.	Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
However many.  It's not enough.	I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.	It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.	Wowie.  How wonderful!
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.	Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
I don't know wh...	I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.	You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...	...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Can I look at the pictures?	It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
It's just not the right time t...	Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.	You mean, after I'm dead?
It's the same choice you made.	Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Looks nice enough to m...	He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?	It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...	I have their past.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.	Yeh, it's cheaper.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...	I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But?  But what?	But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.	It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Not yet.	Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
It's forever you know.	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.	Rache, it may take time.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.	What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...	Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Hey.	Hey. What's up?
There's something I need to talk about with you.	What?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?	Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?	Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?	It was God's will.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?	No, Mikey.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?	I'm always working.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?	This is work.
Consuelo. Are you crying?	No.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.	My Jesus…
Who is Jesus?	My baby.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.	You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?	What?
Sure!...	Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
What are you going to do?	I dunno.
We did the same thing last year also.	How was the class?
I can read it to you.	You mean, again?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.	Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
What do you want?	Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	You know he hated my story also.
But what kind of pull did you have?	I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.	...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
What DO you know?	Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Whaddya wanna talk about?	Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.	Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.	Sure, Dad.
Hello, Vi.	What are you doing here?
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...	I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?	Take off your top.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.	Say, Ni...
Fuck me hard!	Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?	Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!	Great!
That's too bad.	I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah. But not any more.	Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?	Yeah, sure.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.	You should be.
You know...I like you.	Yeah. I know.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?	Y-yes--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?	Well, I-I hope that--that--
I'll lead.	Why? Are we going dancing?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?	Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Let's move it we got company!	What happened!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...	You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What do you mean?	After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.	What happened?
Well Filmore--	Well Cooper...
Are the labs in operation?	I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Go fuck yourself...	Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Come on, drink up.	I don't want any...
I insist...	I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Well?	We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!	Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
And what exactly do they intend to do?	The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?	I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.	Richter-we got a problem!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.	Excellent...excellent!
Where the hell could they have gone!	What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...	You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--	Dissent?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--	How much of this shit do they have, White!!
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Thank you, Admiral.	Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Where are you trying to reach him?	At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.	Did you get that, Kulnick?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?	First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
Yes?	Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.	It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?	I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 	See!  See, I told you.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.	Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?	Look, I didn't shoot him!
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 	Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.	Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.	What is your name, young lady?
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
General Schmuck?	Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!	I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?	Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.	This is General Ripper speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?	No, sir.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.	That's right, sir.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.	I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.	Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Are you hard of hearing, Major?	No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.	I know that, sir.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?	Ask away, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?	You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.	You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.	Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?	Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.	You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.	But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Go on, Major.	I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.	Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.	Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Major, you're talking like one of them!	Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.	Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.	But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.	Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.	And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?	What the hell is Plan-R?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.	Why can't you cancel it?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 	That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?	Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Have you tried the recall again?	Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?	If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.	Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.	Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.	They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Maximum ECM.	Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Check.	Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Roger.	Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.	Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
No, this looks like the real thing.	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary arming switch.	Primary arming switch.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.	Very interesting.
What's your point, Lothar?	Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Second safety.	Seond safety.
Primary bomb is live.	All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
How do you know he's dead?	Hell, he looks dead.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?	You tell me.
Who's that?	It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?	But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?	Let me check.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.	Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?	I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.	Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Um-hm.	Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.	I don't anymore.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.	Yeah.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.	Yeah, I guess.
That was really great.	Was it okay?
Uh-huh.	I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Typical male.	Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?	No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.	Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Any gunshot victims?	Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Sounds like a bummer.	Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
No, he's not with a girl.	Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?	Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
A long, long, long...	Okay.
Go!	... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?	No, no.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?	No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.	No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Sure.	No, I mean, no one.
Yeah.	Uh, last night...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.	Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Oh, and guess who showed up.	No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
I know, man.	You know?
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.	No.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.	Jeff! Let's go!
Hey, I'm Sooze.	Yeah, right, publicist.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Wait, what happened to the tree?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.	Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Your his publicist?	Sure I am. It's fun.
So, then, you're, like, available?	In what way?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.	This is private property, my friend.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.	Are you talking to me?
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?	Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.	No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?	Yes!
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.	Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
I'd like to.	Oh, yeah?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.	Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Mm.	He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
I'd love to read that.	Funny shit, man.
Can you tell me what happened?	He's drunk.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.	Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.	Sooze wants to see him.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.	Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
See ya later.	What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.	I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?	No.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?	Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!	Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.	No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
You lied to me.	You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
I don't know.	You don't know?
Jeff! Come up here!	Is that Bee-Bee?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.	Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?	Nazeer Chaudry!
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.	No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.	You know, all you know is what's good for you.
This is ridiculous!	Tim!
Jeff. Jeff.	... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Come with me.	No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
So what do you wanna do?	Nothing.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?	Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Oh, yeah?	I, yeah.
I've run out of words.	Wait. What, what are you saying?
Do your covers and all that shit.	'Bye, Jeff.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?	Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.	Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Really?	Yeah, really.
Now?	Yeah.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.	Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?	No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.	Well, what about this?
Look, get down off my property.	Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Look Pakeesa...	Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
I hope you're happy!	This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Is that your driver?	It's stupid.
Oh!	Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
No, she was just sitting there?!	Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah?	Yeah.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.	Yeah.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.	That's because I am.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.	Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.	Where do you get your ideas?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.	"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.	What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?	It's none of my business?
Just one?	Yeah.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?	Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?	It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.	Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, your gonna regret this.	Come on, Jeff.
Leave him alone, Tim.	Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.	Oh that's nice for you.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.	There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
What?!	You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.	You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Another sex dream?	Wayne Gretzky.
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.	My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!	No...I've been pregnant.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.	No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.	And they get caught!
... I don't know.  Probably not.	So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
But, we have to make a smart plan!	Of course - of course!  Hands in...
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.	That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
I sure do.	Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?	Trix...
I know, but that was before.	Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Madonna.	We're here for you, Diane.
Shut up.	Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Oh no...	He Ikea'd us.
Yeah?	I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Really...	Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
You sure you wanna go there?	Uh...maybe?
All of you!	Bank branch!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.	Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.	My what?
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!	Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.	Stop it!  This is crazy!
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.	I hear she was a terror to work with.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.	You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Roll 'em.	Action! The scene starts.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?	Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.	I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
It's from hunger.	Nothing for Ladd?
This is Miss Kramer.	Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Name dropper.	I just think pictures should say a little something.
If I could be of any help...	I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.	Sure.  Bases Loaded.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.	Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.	I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
With a wildly beating heart.	Life can be beautiful!
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.	Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.	Well, for heaven's sake!
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.	Why should you do that?
What about all those ideas you had?	See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.	This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.	It will?
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...	Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?	Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.	It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
Hello, Betty.	I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Her own movie theatre.	I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.	No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.	Joe, I can't look at you any more.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...	That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
What assistant?	Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.	Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?	Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.	Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!	Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I wrote that with my heart.	Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?	I don't know.
What month?	December twenty-first.
It's getting kind of late --	Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
There sure is.	You can stay here.
You'll like it here.	Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.	I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.	I'm used to paying my own bills.
What's that?	Just a scene I cut out.
What scene?	The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
I need some money right now.	Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.	What's wrong with It?
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.	I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
The other guests?	There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Hold me tighter.	Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?	Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Go away.	What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --	Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Have one of mine.	They're awful.  They make me cough.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.	Maybe deMille is shooting.
He must be quite a guy.	He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.	Good night.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?	I went for a walk.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.	I haven't done anything, Norma.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!	Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.	You think I made that up about the gun...
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel	Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --	Go on in.
You are not dressed properly.	Dressed for what?
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.	Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Whose room was this?	It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.	I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.	That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
What's the matter, Max?	I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.	It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
We've come for the car.	What car?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?	It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Got a title?	Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?	Frankly, no.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.	Maybe what you need is another agent.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?	Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.	Yes, Madame.
Paramount studios.	Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.	What is it?
What does it mean?	The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.	And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Is he your entertainment for tonight?	He will be. In about five minutes.
A Storm Dragon?	No, a super girl.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.	I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.	Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
At last. Ultimate Power.	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
You're alive! She didn't kill you!	Who didn't?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.	It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
You're not afraid are you?	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Is this how?	Terrific.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---	Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.	I sort of like what you said.
I'm not mad at you.	It seemed that way to me.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
A little.	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Oh no, not you again.	What an adorable hat.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?	Well...I guess I can't.
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!	How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.	Did anybody notice you?
I can't help it if men notice me.	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Superman will return it.	Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
I'm sorry... I didn't know.	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I can do that.	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.	But what for?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.	It doesn't seem right.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.	He's nice.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?	I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.	Throw him out.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.	Not yet.
What's it like?	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Where is inner space?	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
There is a way.	I knew it!
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Goodbye...	Zaltar!
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
What are you talkin' about?	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Not enough vodka in it.	There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!	What? What did you tell me?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?	Brad.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --	Brad Wilson.
You look wonderful.	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?	It sure is.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?	You thought that?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.	But all he had was chocolate milk.
He really was!	Uh-huh.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Uh...excuse me, folks...	Kent!
Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?	Say!
You're the best, Lois.	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Name?	Gus Gorman.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?	Yeah.
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.	Thirty-five.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.	What about this week's check?
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!	Black or regular?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?	Which country?
How do you do that?	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
When?	First question got to be "Where."
Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!
Uh...what channel were you watching?	What are you talking about, fella?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.	They ain't got captains?
And then shut down the pipe lines.	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Now...when do I get a taste?	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Is this blackmail?	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.	For what?
Everything.	What will it get me?
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...	Sister! I'm his sister!
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.	What about me?
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
53.	53!
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.	Why do I have to do this?
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
It could make weather!	Storms! Floods!
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!	Today coffee----
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.	Don't cry, Bubba.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...	We can get to work on that oil!
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.	But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Oh Clark, no!	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
It's true. It's true.	Lois, I . . .
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Hi.	Oh, hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "	You're not selfish at all.
"They?"	Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Lois, someday --	Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
But . . ..that's terrible!	That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
What??	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!	I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
I like trees.	So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
This way Lex.	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.	It's beautiful.
It has everything.	Wrong.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?	Yes.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.	No possibility for parole?
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.	I asked the right question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -	I didn't ask her anything . . .
Why?	To ski?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.	Oh! That black box in our cell?
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.	Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .	Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
What more?	Cuba.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.	It will. Starting with your own.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
So this is the planet Houston . . .	What shall we do now?
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.	Yes?
He's captured Non!	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .	Don't worry, I've got you.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Superman? Has something happened to him?	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
But Superman isn't an average man.	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?	Absolutely!
Awesome!	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.	. . . And  very naïve!
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!	A toupee that flies?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
The one Superman wrecked up?	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.	There!
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.	What?
You think he'll find us.	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Destroy Superman!	Wait! Not yet! Back!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!	We're running out of smoke.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.	He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Do you know where you're headed?	North. It's north
I'd like to.	Well!
Your bookie?	No.
Hey!	What the  --  !
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
There weren't any wires. I looked.	Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.	You're not the only one.
Listen...thank you.	You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Oh.	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
This??	Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Nuts. He made it.	Tough guy, huh?
Krypton!	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Meteorites!	Bingo!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Don't let me down.	You?! How about me?
You're not going to hit me?	Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.	A night on the town instead of under it?
You got wax in your ears?	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?	Lex is going bye-bye.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!	You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Two.	'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -	Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.	A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
You've been doing some research in the archives.	I want to know what my child is going to face.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -	Enjoyed it?
Lois, the kickback story...	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Who...who...	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?	Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Oh.	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
It must feel great.	It's not bad.
How old are you?	Thirty-five.
What's the matter, Otis?	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?	I guess I...uh...regressed.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Yes.	Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally Jones.	How is Mrs. Stephens?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.	Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
What...does it turn to?	It turns to steaming piss.
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.	You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Hi, Nicole.	Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.	Was it good?
I'll be back around nine.	Okay.
Are you sure?	Yeah.
Because it's what we have to do.	Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.	So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...	C'mon, you know that won't...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.	I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?	No.  It should be dry by now.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...	Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
I have to.	Why?
Because I have to.	Well I don't.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...	Do they have any reputation for drugs?
From what?	Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.	And what's that?
What do you mean?	You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.	Did his parents attend to that?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...	Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.	What other people?
You want a cup of tea or something?	A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.	No.  A little sugar though.
What happened to summer?	Summer's over.  It's fall.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.	I won't lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.	You seem very sure about that.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.	Was the bus on time?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'	Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
What about Doreen?	She...she was a friend of mine.
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
Crafts.	Crafts?
Here we go.	Thanks.
We do.	Is there shrimp on it?
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.	Who did they get for that?
You think someone else caused the accident?	Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.	And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You saw the speedometer?	Yes.
What do you remember about the accident?	I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
That was great.	Really?
Do you like the colour?	It's okay.
Nothing good on your T.V.?	As opposed to this T.V.?
Yes.	How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Will the police do anything to her?	It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.	But Charlene...
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.	You don't know that.
But of course...	Alone or surrounded?
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -	Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I still think he's responsible for the smear.	Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Joe, give my nephew a drink.	Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?	Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
You told him that?	Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?	Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.	I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."	And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.	Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...	Give me a chance --
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?	He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...	But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.	I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!	I'm taking up the situation with you now...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...	A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?	No...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?	No.  I'm going home.
Hello, Harry.	Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.	You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?	You print them, don't you?
I know Steve.  No.	Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
How?	Get Steve back his job...please...
He means that much to you...?	Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...	No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...	She knows now.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?	He goes out with girls.
I thought he would.	Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
Bribing me again?	And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?	No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
And where was his wife?	I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Help me with two minutes of silence!
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???	Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...	Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?	Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"	Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!	Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?	You tell him, I stutter!
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.	What ship?
J.J., if you think -	Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -	That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?	Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.	Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!	But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
You going to work all day?	I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
Radical.	You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?	Max.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?	It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.	Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!	Why?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.	No problemo.
Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.	I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
No!	I'm sorry, John.
So she's pretty cool, huh?	Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?	I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
John, get out of the way!!	SHOOT!!!!
I know!	Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.	Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
You broke my arm!	There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.	And Skynet fights back.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.	Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
It's finally over.	No.  There is another chip.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.	Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.	But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.	A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?	Not yet.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?	Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.	In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.	There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.	I have a duty.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?	No. Ours was damaged.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?	I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
How come?	Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
Your guess is as good as mine.	I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Tough, tough!	Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
Why were they going to arrest you?	I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?	During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?	If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.	Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.	Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Then you are wrong.	Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
have no idea what ordinary people thought.	No!
Stop this, please, stop this now!	No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.	I don't understand what you mean.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?	It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.	Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Major.	Helmuth.
Yes, you remember.	How could I forget?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.	Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
One of your people told me.	One of my people?
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?	No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.	Who's he?
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.	Like this bandleader.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.	Absolutely not.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.	He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	You're late.
Aren't I worth waiting for?	Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Can you handle it?	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Anything else?	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.	We will, kiddo.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?	What's it to ya?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.	Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
There's so much...	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.	What?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?	What about it?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?	That's the way it was told to me.
What's that?	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
And so you feel nothing.	It's better that way.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...	Kyle...
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?	Yes.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--	That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Here's her driver's license.	You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.	Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?	Now, look...
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.	Did you?  Kudos.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.	I said I was sorry...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?	What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
You've got to be kidding.	What... is... happening... ?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.	What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...	You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Don't even think about it.	Why not?
I'll give you a boost.	You first.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?	You pull me up.
This is C.R.S.	What's C.R.S.?
You're the one who started running.	Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
That one did.	... two hundred dollars a toe.
Never did catch your name.	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Goodnight.	I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?	Well... the red bra.
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
Who is it?	What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.	What... what do you mean?
What do you think you're doing?	You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
They won't...	They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...	What are you doing?
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...	Stop it!
Julliard, yeah.	Single?
Hey there, Nickie.	Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.	"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.	Which grad-school?
Never better.	Elizabeth?
You need anything?	No.
Will you?	I said I would...
Do it for YOU.	Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?	You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
Do you know how to change a tire?	No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...	Stop this.  It's not true...
What?	This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?	Yes.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.	Yes.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.	I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.	What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...	No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Physical?	Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.	Don't take another step.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...	Have we met?
Hm?	Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?	No, you didn't...
Thank you.	Have a nice day.
Dinner's in the oven.	Thank you.  Goodnight.
You did?  How is he?	Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?	Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
What's this about?	It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.	His behavior... ?
What?	A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Anything wrong... ?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Nicholas...	That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
How concerned should I be?	It was a misunderstanding.
He hasn't called back.	What about the house?
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?	What?
I only saw Theo drive up.	Who's Watts?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?	I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
That could have been worse.	Yeah.
Luke, can I talk to you?	Sure.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.	Go ahead.
Is that the question of compassion or science?	It's a question.
It's not going to hold your weight.	Just stay there, Nell!
Well, this lot is full!	He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
What did it smell like?	It was very specific.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.	I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Like she smelled it too?	Yes.
Are you coming to confess?	I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.	Nell.  You will come here now.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!	Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.	How'd I know it was for you?
When do we take the tests?	Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Maybe they're Mary's.	Mary came with me.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.	How could you do this to people?
Why do you need a chain like that?	That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?	I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!	It's all I could afford.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.	My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Theo... Did you?	Maybe you did it yourself.
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.	Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Nell, what happened?	Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!	Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.	I don't think I want any.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?	I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Not for you, clearly.	I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.	All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.	Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
No.	Why not?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.	This is un-fucking professional.
You should have let me do the talking.	Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.	And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.	You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Oh really?  Where you from?	England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?	Round about, yeah.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.	It was better than a telegram.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.	Terry Valentine.
What more is there.	I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?	That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?	Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.	Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
You're kiddin' me, right?	What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.	Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Who'd you butcher at the house?	Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
Huh?	He's brought in the heavy mob.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?	You goin' back inside?
Didn't get it.	Well, those are the breaks.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?	No, but I know what he means.
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
What was that, then?	I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?	Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Oh, it just ended, then.	Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.	Not ashamed.
Disappointed.	She never told Eddie, though.
-- Your employer?	-- Mr. Lindgren.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.	We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.	He alive to see this?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?	Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.	A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.	She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.	How do you know?
Yeah, I guess you are.	Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Of the deal, man.	Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.	And that is?
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.	My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.	He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Don't you work with Ian?	Ian?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?	Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.	Nine years?  Is that legal?
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.	Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?	I don't know.
She's nice lookin'.	So what.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.	Lemme break.
There is?	Something's on.
Like what.	Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
He's expecting you?	I doubt it.
You know her?	Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Where is he, then?	Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
You've made it ... brighter.	I don't want you here, Terry.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.	Susan.
Yes?	We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Ann--	A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?	Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Hello, Rachel.	I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.	That's what he keeps telling me.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.	Boy.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--	Oh, Mr Crane--
...I stank, didn't I?	He didn't say that.
...Mm.	Well? How'd she do?
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.	I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
...she can go up there.	Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!	That right.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?	I'll have it in a week.
No problem!	Way out of line.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?	Sure.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?	Yeah.
All right.	And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
...Oh, Jesus.	...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
...What kind of man *are* you?	...Huh?
Rye.	Just coffee.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?	Honey?
Come on, get ready. It's important.	Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Dave.	How's that?
...What's so damn strange about that?	I didn't say a word.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.	Honey...
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?
...Doris--	Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
OK, how did you know?	I... just knew. A husband knows.
Will anyone else say they knew?	I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?	I took Doris's keys.
Taking it seriously.	So, who should I--
...Probity.	Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.	Sorry, I just didn't remember.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?	Uh-huh.
...You sure, Eddie?	Yeah, yeah--go home.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.	Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!	Yeah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!	Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.	Uh-huh.
...We goin'?	Huh? No.
Mr...?	Crane. Ed Crane.
Hello!	Hello.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.	Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.	They sent us to tell ya.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.	Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.	I'm in.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.	We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.	Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.	What's the combination?
Forget it!	Calm down.  I found it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.	Let's go!
Ippolito!  Get back here!	Like hell!
Who are you?  The undertaker?	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?	Correct.
How big is the sub-basement?	Apparently it's huge.
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?
It's still back there!	I know.
What are we talking about here?	Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.	We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.	Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.	I'm not giving up.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.	You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.	Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
What is it?	I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Like the claw.	Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.	That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."	Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.	Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
What's going on?	Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.	We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Come back and get me.	We will.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.	Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.	I don't believe it.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?	They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.	Big as a house.
Not that big.	Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.	They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.	The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Stop!	Holy mother, what is that?
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?	Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Jesus, what is this?	Another storage room.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.	But at what a price.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.	Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.	You have time to talk?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.	You were afraid of him, weren't you?
My God.  Then it was an animal.	I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
What happened?	I don't know.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.	You were behind me?  Running after me?
What was it?	I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?	No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.	It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --	We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
That was D'Agosta.	The planetarium!
Is there another way around?	No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
What happened?	Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
We have to try and draw it off!	How?
Just like John.  He won't listen.	I have to shoot.
Viti Levu.  For how many?	One.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.	We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--	--a dead one at that.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?	As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--	All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Sure she would.	Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.	So when are you leaving?
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?	Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.	Your Dad?!
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.	It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?	Truman, you're gonna be late!
What's that?	It's a surprise.
Where have you been?	I've been thinking--
What did you want?	I made macaroni.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?	You blaming me for the traffic?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?	There's been an accident, Truman.
Truman, what about that sign?	I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.	Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.	Do something...
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?	--Truman, you're gonna be late!
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.	Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
How's it going, Truman?	Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
I think you better tell us.	We don't even know you.
I need your clothes, Byers.	Me?
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --	Nothing completely conclusive --
This man's still alive.	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?	No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
And if it's unsuccessful?	Incinerate it. Like the others.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?	No. Don't bother.
You follow me out here for a reason?	Yeah, I did.
Who sent you?	I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --	Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.	You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
You told me you had answers.	Yeah, well I don't have them all.
You've been using me --	I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --	I told you -- he and I were old friends --
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.	Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Mulder...?	What happened to playing a hunch?
Jesus, Mulder...	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Had you.	No you didn't.
Where are you, Mulder?	I'm in the vending room.
Scully?	Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
What? What are you talking about?	I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.	They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?	According to this tag.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.	You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
This looks like new grass to you?	It looks pretty green for this climate.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.	All the equipment is brand new.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?	I don't know, Mulder.
And where are they going with it?	That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --	-- of what exactly?!
Been where?	Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
You hear that?	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --	I need you on this, Scully --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.	I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
On whose orders?	General McAddie's.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --	But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.	I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
A virus?	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.	That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?	No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.	You need not kill a man to destroy him.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.	Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
I do it all the time!	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I'd be there for him.	And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?	Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...	I don't need them anymore...
...give a kiss to Edward.	Give a kiss to Edward.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?	As far as I needed.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...	You don't know the procedure.
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.	Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?	Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...	Little boy?!  That's him!
That went well.	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
He's mine?	All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
Thank you.	No problem.
She changed the codes.	What's wrong?
Instead of going into his mind...	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Is she alright?	Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
You're looking well.	Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
How's the patient.	Awaiting his arrival.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.	It's his dog.
We proceed assuming she is.	Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
Den leuten.	Ja, ja, ja.
You were awfully good.	Do you understand German?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.	I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Can I hear you?	In German?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?	Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Gestern bein heurigen...	What's that?
H-E-Z-T...	Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Holly.	I'm so sorry.
I wish I knew.	Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I'm going back home.	Why?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.	I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
...again.	There isn't enough for two laughs.
Are you going, too?	Oh...
...is there?	How did you know I would be here?
How do you know?	I saw him today.
Oh, well.	Why are you lying?
...quarrel?	If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?	Thank you.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?	We loved each other, do you mean that?
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?	Two weeks ago.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.	I don't know.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.	I don't want it.
Where?	Just around the corner.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?	Holly Martins.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"	I can't say that I have.
...to him.	What are you trying to say?
Listen, Callaghan.	Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
What the devil?	Getting around, Martins.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?	Calloway.
This is where he vanished.	I see.
A girl of spirit.	She's right. It's none of my business.
Didn't I?	You all did.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...	I said you win.
What time is it?	Two thirty.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.	Oh, Mr. Martins...
Welcome?	I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
They wouldn't know me.	Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.	Goodness, that's awkward.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.	Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What's that?	Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.	Of course, of course, of course.
Striptease, sir.	Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular, sir.	Very popular. Are you staying long?
Listen...	Yes.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...	It's good to see you, Holly.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.	I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
...you.	Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.	What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Dr. Winkel?	Vinkel.
Could he have been at all conscious?	I understand...
Did you know Mr. Lime well?	Mr. Lime - yes.
...Popescu...	und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.	You saw it?
The Roumanian?	Yes.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.	Funny?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.	Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.	I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.	I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
We think in miles, not kilometers.	So how many miles do you think it is?
A shark fin?	I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?	Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.	Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.	I'm sorry.
What about Moliere?	Fuck off.
Bonsoir.	Eh - bonsoir.
Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.	Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Too far?	If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?	We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
No one follows that midrash.	I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.	Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.	The Zionists aren't Nazis.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.	They sound like you.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....	Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.	Then I won't bring you....
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?	Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.	Fire...
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.	No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.	I have a job.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.	I don't care about money.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?	Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too difficult?	Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Which is what?	At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Why no silencer?	You want it to be an event.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.	Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.	Oh, really?
Bigger and better.	Then how come you're talking to me?
Where'd you get this?	I stole it. From a synagogue.
How come there's no punctuation?	That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Do you know it like that? By heart.	No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?	What do you care?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...	What's it mean?
I want to learn to read it.	Why?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.	Why not?
The sex is better.	Even though his dick is so big?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...	V'asitem...
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.	Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No, I think you shouldn't.	Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?	It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?	'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.	And be crushed.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...	You gotta get out of here.
I didn't realize you cared.	I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Who's Eichmann?	Who's Eichmann?!!?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.	It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....	I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.	Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.	Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Who? How would I know him?	He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?	So you're saying it's not true.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?	Listen to me....
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?	Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?	No.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?	Get the fuck away from me.
I always won.	The arguments, anyway.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?	With the shoes... There was more than one?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?	A forty-five.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.	Fucking kike.
Balint?	It's German.
What part of Germany are you people from?	From the Rhineland originally.
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.	Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
How have things been going?	Fine.
This will be a different kind of device.	That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
That's all we've got left.	It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
When do you want it to go off?	Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
You remember Miriam....	Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.	Wow, that's uh...great...
Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...	Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Who's this?	Dennis Leary.
Leary?	No.
Adam Sandler.	Funny?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.	And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Oh, fuck you...	As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?	Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
He's shy, not like Enzo.	Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?	But your man isn't quite a God!
Johana, am I boring you?	Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Did the driver really freeze?	Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.	... So am I.
Good afternoon.	I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
He seems to have won it.	Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!
Where did you two meet?	In a lake.
Is it a poem?	No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Because you'd laugh.	I won't, I swear.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?	No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
He can learn.  He is learning.	You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Is he alright?  What happened?	The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
What about the shoes?	Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
And where did you say you were from?	I didn't say...  Brussels!
What's with the voice?	It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!	What room have you got?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?	Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
No.	Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?	Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Why?  Are they what's most important?	No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?	... Yes.
... How long was I asleep?	Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
You were right.	... I was right about what?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.	... Okay.  I'll try.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!	I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?	I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Uh... Yes, of course!
Jacques, you set a world record.	I did?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.	I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
So have I.  ... Hello?	I'm still here.
Well, then, talk to me some more.	... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
What?	... Nothing.
Jacques...?	You go back, I'll walk.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?	... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?	Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Assassin!	Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?	He doesn't hear too well.
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?	Well... here.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?	Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.	Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Any sign of Santa?	He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.	C'mon follow me.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.	No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.	When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.	No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.	Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...	Mazel Tov!
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.	I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!	But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
What are you doing?	Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
How do we bypass it?	The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
What are you doing?	Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Hammer, you alright?	Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.	If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?	Why not?
Is he in love with you?	I don't know —-
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?	You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.	Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
What did they say before the bad card came up?	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.	Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?	Who?
He will be waiting...	You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.	Rosita —— I have wondered -—
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.	She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——	You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.	Good evening.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——	Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.	Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
It could be a man.	It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.	Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
It was you.	Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.	Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
What do you do now?	There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.	I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Wait ——	No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.	Something's wrong with this whole setup --
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.	Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Get it out of here!	Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's easy. Me.	I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!	Yeah.
I can use them.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.	He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
And she waited here for him?	Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --	Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --	If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --	Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	What! You can't be --
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.	We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?	Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?	You a tourist?
That might depend on where you’re going.	I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.	When will they be back?
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?	You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.	Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.	What... What are you talking about?
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.	Excuse me?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?	Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.	You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Mr Lombard?	Have you got a pen?
When did you get back?	Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?	I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?	Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?	I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?	Something like that.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.	Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.	What are you doing? You can’t. I...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.	Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...	The dead can wait.
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.	A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?	A coffee and a couple of croissants.
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?	Croissants. Like that...
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?	I’m fine standing, thank you.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...	Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.	Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?	Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...	So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.	Italian? The Mafia...?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?	That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!	Emily...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 	She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Why?	This is a bad line.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?	What sort have you got?
So, what are you looking for?	What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?	Tomorrow?
Who are you?	Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...	...On holiday?
Who’s the money man?	Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
And who does Friedman work for?	The company. We all work for the company.
What’s the Ambassador?	Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?	I’ll call again.
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?	Can I have the reception desk, please.
You sure you passed on my message?	I certainly did, sir...
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?	La what?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?	That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...	Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 	What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
May I...?	May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
What if it is?	Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...	He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.	Anything at all?
Clients come and go.	This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Where is Friedman?	Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
What is it?	This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.	I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...	Shut up!
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...	Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...	Do you know Leon’s parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?	My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?	Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.	Tu sais où me trouver.
Gluck.	Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Five seconds. Then you die.	Fuck...
So why didn’t he?	What do you think, huh?
When they realise I’m missing...	Shut up and walk...
Mossad?	It’s a good guess...
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...	Very generous of you all.  How much?
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?	No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.	Now?
Jeanne, stop it!	How dare you stop me doing God's will!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!	How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...	Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...	Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?	You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
No, but...	Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?	To marry you.
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.	I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
Will you at least let me stay with you?	It would not be the same without you.
We must sound the retreat!	Not yet!
Do as I say!	I want to stay with you...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!	I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
And?	And so I... I prefer my banner.
No, I... I held it up to...	You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...	... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?	She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...	Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...	Scared of a girl?
Quick -- hide in here...	What about you?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?	I will hear you... but not now, not here.
The English??	Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?	In a village called Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.	Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?	Not unless you hear my confession.
What did it tell you?	Many things...
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...	I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...	Buying her?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.	W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!	Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Is it long and hanging down?	I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.	I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?	20,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.	I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...	I know...
Wait, wait...	For what?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.	Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...	I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Stand by with the battering-rams...	We need another ten minutes...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!	Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?	As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!	Me too...
And... what does Jeanne think?	I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.	But the bridge has been pulled down!
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?	I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?	Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Jeanne... we're not enough...	So... bring up the reinforcements!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!	Jeanne, look behind you.
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...	But my voices... they promised me...
Did your voice tell you to jump?	No...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?	No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?	That's now what I meant...
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!	I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?	Yes, but...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??	Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!	They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!	I'd sooner die than use magic!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...	... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...	A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
What have you done to me?	I -- I -- I...
My... visions...	They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!	I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What signs?	Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...	So your memory's coming back?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?	In His name??
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.	I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?	Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.	Do you think this cross will protect you?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...	Do you think you are ready?
Yes I am.	Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
But you already confessed this morning...	I need to confess again.
Is that bad?	Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?	Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
So... everything sounds... wonderful?	Yes, it is.
A beauty. Who is she?	A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.	Oh, yes. I remember.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.	You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.	Wladek, please.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	How will we sleep?
Must feel better this side of the wall.	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
I'm on the run!	What's happened?
Henryk's in there.	I haven't seen him.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.	Who told you?
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --	That makes a change.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?	You're out, aren't you?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?	I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What did you pay him?	Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.	Yes, so did the Germans.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?	Yes, but what good did it do?
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.	There are always notices going up.
Why didn't you come to me?	I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Pig!	Cow!
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?	Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.	God forbid!
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.	Stop it, Wladek.
I don't know how to thank you.	Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.	Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.	That is good, yes.
Which mountains are those dear?	The Alps.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.	Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Well, that is a strong opinion.	Yes, it's unholy.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.	No, no bible readers.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.	I'll be back.
You'd have to organise it up here.	Yes, I thought that.
T-w~e-l-v~e.	Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Yes, why not.	Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
You have to wash them.	They are washed.
We can't leave the piano	Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
What does she say?	She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
He's given it to us.	Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
You the owner here?	That's right.
Which way are the rooms?	Who told ya this guy was in here?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.	What's the line on Visitation?
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.	He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.	How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.	What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.	Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.	Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I'll take him anyway.	Why?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.	We'll get by without 'em.
You just worry about your end, kid.	If we ever get to it.
How'd ya do?	Well we got some workin' money anyway.
No signs of trouble?	What do ya mean?
You think he'll show?	Did he say he wouldn't?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.	Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
I'm not sure I know it.	We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Raise 500.	See ya and raise three.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?	You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
My end was only one.	Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?	Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
It isn't any better.	Where's June today?
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.	Where you goin'?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.	And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You sure it'll be one of these two?	No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...	Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
You should always look to the back too, kid.	I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.	This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
You got the 400 grand yet?	Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?	I'll make parole.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.	If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?	We missed him.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.	Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.	He'll never do it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?	No.
What's your next step, Nick?	Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Why not?	You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.	Is that what it means?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.	Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
Well!	That is, if it's all right with you.
Mind if I look around?	Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?	Oh, Andy, Andy!
Then what are you hiding?	It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Did he tell you where he was going?	He wouldn't say.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.	tried him once -
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.	We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
There. 	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
I don't know.	Which way did she fall?
Dead?	He's been dead for three months.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.	Yes, she would.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.	We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
I know -- I know --	You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?	And he still wants to marry me!
But it isn't bad weather now.	Better get home before it is.
You can take that out to the car.	Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?	Not a thing.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.	I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...	What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
How'd you people happen to pop in?	We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Nothing.	What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.	I'm asking you.
Have you got a pistol permit?	No.
Who's is it?	I'll have to try to remember.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.	You mean about that gun?
Well, what'd you think?	I think we're on the right track.
Could this be him?	I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.	When was that?
There are a few things we want to check up on.	I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?	Why yes.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?	I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
That's ridiculous.	Let him have his say out.
Do you think that Wynant did it?	Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I think we may as well sit down.	I guess all the suspects are here.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.	Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Who's that man?	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.	What bonds?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!	Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
That's my business.	supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Oh, hello.  Come on in.	Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, please, Nick.	Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
One hundred...  two hundred... three...	Never mind.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?	Is Julia going with you?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....	That's all right.  What are you drinking?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.	I haven't been a detective for four years.
I have no right to answer that.	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Oh, Nick... Nick!	Hello, Mimi.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?	Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.	I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Dorothy!  Is she here?	Yes...
Where's Gilbert?	Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?	I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?	He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Perfectly absurd.	And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.	You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 	Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I've never heard about you.	I didn't knock Julia off.
Why tell me?	I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
What's that?	This is your party.
You might have mentioned me first.	He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Pretty girl.	If you like 'em like that.
Who is she?	I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?	Much better, thanks.
What hit me?	That last Martini.
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.	There's nothing I can do to help her.
There's one coming.	Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!	Well, didn't you?
Finished with these?	Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Aren't you hot in that?	I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?	Yes.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".	Let's see.  Where's it from?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.	Your guess is as good as mine.
But Wynant --- ?	I don't believe he did it.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?	Looks like a hold-up!
You mean, he might be hiding there?	I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.	You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.	Not with all your money!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.	I did find him!
Nick!	It was his body that was buried there.
Wynant's body?	Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?	Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
What things made you so sure?	Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	Got a nice evening dress?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
I hope you're well.	His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
How did you get in here?	I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You his wife?	Yes.
I'm sorry...  but...	Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...	I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Who fired you?	You did.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?	Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
What are we going to do!?	We're going to keep driving.
They stopped.	Wha...
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.	You just go when I say go.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.	And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Not much of a pass.	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.	Let me see the map.
You're the one with all the ideas.	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.	Maybe I do.
What happened?	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
I'm the one's got the big stick.	Suppose I don't go for that?
Wes--	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
Give it to me!	If I give it to you, will you let us go?
At-at-at-at-at.	Knock it off!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.	Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.	What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
Now this is war.	Roger that.
Invest it.	Oh, that's fun.
Take the binoculars.	Wh-what do you think--
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?	I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
You didn't step on any mine.	I heard it click.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?	We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Where you going?	Me and Wes are just going to talk.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!	I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
You're going to be fine.	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
They're doing more than slapping.	The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
X marks the spot.	Something like that.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?	Stay low.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?	We're not going to do anything.
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?
He's not going to leave us.	What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Why do I have to stay down here?	Jesus, Jaeger.
We should head Northeast.	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?	We'll find our way.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.	Is it all right if I stand up?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.	Yeah.  Well, me too.
Wonder how the war's going?	It's got to be going better than this..
Getting cold.	It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.	No!
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.	Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
What do we do?	We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
What do you make of them?	Shi'ites, I think.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.	But...
I'm thinking about taking a trip.	Thought you were going to buy a car.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.	He'll slow down.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.	A headache?
You get it yet?	Naw, nothing.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--	What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
Jaeger?	What!?
You ever think about dying?	Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.	You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Epps, is that a sand dune.	Oh, no.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?	...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?	You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Epps...	Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
How long we going to keep this up.	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.	That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Think we can make it?	We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.	Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
It's got a bottom.	Guess we know what the next stop is.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Stress category.	Correct.  Origin?
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?	Vocasity
I'm not hungry.	Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
You know I don't feel well.	Eat your dinner.
When?	Now.
Then why did you bring it up?	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.	What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.	No!  Don't go.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?	I don't want to lose you.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!	You don't know.  You don't....
THX!	No!...No!...
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...	What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
Who?  Who's leaving?	THX and me.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.	I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.	It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 	Where is LUH?
What's going on?	I want you for my roommate.
I'm leaving.	What?
How do you know?	Look more closely.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.	Too late....stay close.
She's not there	No......  She's dead THX........
Yes.	....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
Yes.	My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....	You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...	Yes...
And you are...?	Officer Reilly, vice.
Who the heck're you?	You the Bomb Squad?
Where did you get this?	Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.	Thanks.
What're you talking about?	When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.	Mike Reilly.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.	So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat. We treat devices.	Anything else I should know?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?	Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.	Oh yeah? Prove it.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.	Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Ex-girlfriend?	Be right back.
Driving in circles, waiting for-	Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.	You got it.
Fuck factor?	Off the scale.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!	He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...	Don't touch that.
Something round, two wires ...	That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?	Easy, guys.  
What do you think?	Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Right.	T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
You got it.	We work fast enough for you?
Political.	Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.	Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.	Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
What do ay say?	Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.	Thank you.
What's the matter?	Nothing... just tired.
Who are you calling, sis?	What? Nobody, I-
Drop it.	Take him!
I want to work this.	You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
What the hell was that?	A ticking bomb...
What about the ballistics report?	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.	No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.	Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Oh shit...	Fuck factor ten.
P.E.T.N ...	What?
Vice cop on a homicide?	Captain assigned me to assist you.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.	He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.	I promised her she'd be safe.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-	I know.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?	Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Yes.	And diamonds in the front.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.	At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
Eleven o'clock! 	A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
And harems ... ?	<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Good morning, Major.	Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.	The type they marry.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?	Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.	If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.	Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?	Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--	Yes, Baron?
You can trust me.	Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.	Just a second.
I hope you find the figures correct.	I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--	For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Very well, m'sieu.	Otherwise I'll call the police
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.	What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.	I know it!
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.	Now just a minute, Major--
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?	No--no.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!	Why should you?
Please.	Thank you.
I like you, Baron.	I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...	Last year? It can't be that long.
The fourteenth of May.	And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.	Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--	Certainly!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--	Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.	Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.	I know that niche.
You like that statue?	Not particularly.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.	I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--	Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.	Oh!
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.	M'sieu Laval!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.	Too much blue in crimson.
Eighteenth century.	Yes!
It's disgraceful!	Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Yes, madame?	What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Then a little nap--	How do you like my dress?
Crimson!	Correct!  Good night.
Precisely.	Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
No--yours, madame.	M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
You look beautiful.	Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Lovely.	Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes, madame?	You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
About what?	Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Yes, madame?	How much is your salary?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.	Thank you, Rose.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.	A hundred and one next month.
Holy shit.	Don't drop it Rose.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.	Don't you mean work me?
We're too late.	There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
What could possible be funny?	I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --	The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.	I was tired.
Something serious has happened.	That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.	Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.	I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!	Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
You know somebody?	Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.	If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
Ever been to Wisconsin?	No.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.	You're crazy.
So, you got a name by the way?	Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.	You're welcome. Rose.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?	That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.	That penguin last night, is he one of them?
So don't marry him.	If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.	Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
And these were drawn from life?	Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.	She had beautiful hands.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!	You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?	Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?	Sure. If you like.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.	I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Fabrizio said you might be up --	Sssshh. Come here.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.	Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.	He does landscapes.
Now it's worse.	Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Will this work?	We'll find out.
I'm not going without you.	Get in the boat, Rose.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.	It's so cold.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.	Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
I'm sorry.	We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...	Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.	Charmed, I'm sure.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?	It's so unfair.
Anya, I think you're crazy.	Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
It would be a nice change from you.	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Hope we're not intruding.	This is Miss Marsh.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.	I can explain--
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?	Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Oh--a hundred times--	--and I can tell you where to get off.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!	Will you leave me alone?
Good afternoon--	Glad to see you again.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.	Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.	I don't understand.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.	Montana?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?	Guess again, copper.
Aces full.	And me coming in with two pair-- 
I'm so sorry!	Want to take it back?
I thought you were one of my friends.	I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Nice lines--	Yes--
Where have you been hiding?	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Yes?	Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.	But I'll have cocktails with you.
When?	At seven-thirty?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.	You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.	Jimmy!
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?	I thought you were a smart guy.
We coulda got two third-class!	No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!	No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Nix, the law!	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.	I'll watch for him, sir.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.	How're the tips?
Not a chance.	Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Thank you, sir. 	I'll take one. 
On the drunk.	Get it!
Come in! 	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
How's your mother feeling?	Much better--thank you--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--	Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.	Why?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.	Hey!--you're tickling me.
Hello, young fellow!	Coming to the pool for a swim?
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.	It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?	Why, I--
Here's your fifty.	Thanks. That makes us square.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.	Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Your wife knows that, don't she?	Sure.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.	How?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.	Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?	Back is in New York.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."	Send that.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?	She's in New York.
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.	Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--	It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.	Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?	No--not much--excepting-- 
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?	No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.	News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.	I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.	I'll never love anybody else.
Why--don't you like him?	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.	What do you mean?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?	Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?	I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!	Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?	All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.	Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--	Good-night, folks.
That's him! That's the sucker!!	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.	The country boy's about due.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 	Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
How much did you lose?	About twelve hundred.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.	It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
I wish I could.	Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?	Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.	Not a chance--I'm through. 
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--	This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!	Good night!
There you are, sir.	Thank you.
I'm all right.	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?	500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
God damn son of a...	Isn't that a daisy?
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?	Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Where'd you get that horse?	Beauty, ain't he?
Shut up, Ike.	And you must be Doc Holliday.
I'm retired.	Good.  That's real good.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?	This brand.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.	Well... 'bye.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...	No...
You don't even know him.	Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
How you feeling, Doc?	Better.
Since when is faro a business?	Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.	Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.	And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much	Sorry, sorry...
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.	Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?	A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
So what does he want?	What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?	Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.	All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.	Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!	Awful lot of money.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.	You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!	What was that all about?
No.	What?
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.	Good God, you're really-
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.	All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.	Colorado's closer
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.	He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-	It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
What is it?	Easy now... That mare's in season.
That was lovely!	You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?	Where do you get these questions?
Doesn't suit you.	How would you know?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.	Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
What's wrong?	I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.	Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.	Fortuitous even.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.	Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I hate Sadie.	Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.	I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...	I forgave you the moment you said it.
What can I get you?	Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Oh, all right.	Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.	No really, I can stay a while.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?	Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
'Least you admit it.	Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.	I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.	No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
What'd you do that for?	So he can tell the story.
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.	They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Well what do you think happens When you die?	Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.	Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.	Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.	What're you talkin' about?
That thunder's sure somethin'.	That didn't sound like thunder.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.	Will somebody get the damn dog out-
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?	Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
That a fact?	Yeah.  It's a fact.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.	Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.	Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!	Jack...
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.	But she doted on the frowner
Pretty fun too, isn't it?	Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.	Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-	Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
What about all these saloons?	Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?	Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
I'm sure they will.	Good-bye, Mister Bond.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.	Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'	I appreciate your time -
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.	Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Yes -	Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Don't you think you're overreacting?	Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Oh, James. I've missed you -	Is this another one of your games?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?	No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Do you feel better now?	Do you?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?	He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.	Political considerations?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?	Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.	I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
That's reassuring.	Hey - the world is my office.
Natalya?	Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.	I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Bourbon. Neat.	I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Do I have to do everything around here?	I hope so.
Blood or Dutch?	He was my father's best friend!
This has got to be a mistake.	The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Down?	Up.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.	... We have time for that?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.	...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
And when might that be?	Now.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.	I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
... And what do you call these?	Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.	Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!	Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.	Excellent.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.	Approaching the first gate.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.	Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?	No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Who is that?!? What's in the box??	I don't know. He's not in the database -
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.	I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?	You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.	Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.	I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.	I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Who is it?	Babe Brother.
I'm going back home with Harry.	I've heard some foolish things in my life.
I'm busy.	Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.	Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
Not anymore, not in the city.	We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.	Hush.
You're always taking his side.	Hush.
Well, it's up to Suzie.	It would be nice.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.	No, I'm too hot now.
Since this morning.	What happened to your hand?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...	I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.	He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window	I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.	I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?	It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.	'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.	You should go back and rest.
How is everybody?	Tolerable well.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.	You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?	I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.	Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.	Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.	"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.	Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.	Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
When did you talk to Harry?	Don't shout!
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.	Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Wow!  Cool!	Whadda ya think?
Yeah!	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!	Oh, yeah!
Can I bring some toys?	You can bring ONE toy...
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?	No, I haven't seen him.
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.	But Mom, I can't find him!
Can I help pump the gas?	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.	But what if we leave them behind?
Which one can I open first?	Let's let Molly open one.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --	Watch yourself!!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!	Where?
What's going on?	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.	But we're not on my planet, are we?
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Woody!  It's the moving van.	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.	Woody!
Woody?!  What are you doing?	Hold still, Buzz!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!	Not today!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Hey, watch it!	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!	How 'bout three out of five?
I don't know!	Oh no, Hannah!
What?	Look!  Janie!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!	Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?	That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?	No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?	Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!	Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
They're getting bigger.	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
What the heck is up there?	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.	Yes SIR!
Okay, we're on the last present now...	Last present!
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.	Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Reach for the sky!!	Huh?
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!	Got it.
I can manage.	Excuse me.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.	I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?	Get away from me...
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.	Is that all?
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?	Finn -
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.	It was only a mouthful!
I already lost everything once.	So did I.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.	So had I.
I... I don't really know.	Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?	I can't find Manolo.
Why does he need money?	He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.	I want to believe you.  I really do.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?	Arnie, this is crazy.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.	Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?	It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?	I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.	Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
How long have you known?	Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.	Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.	The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Did you tell Dad?	Not yet.
You all right?	I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Helena --	We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --	How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".	Will we get invited to the White House?
Live with your parents?	Yes.
Private?	Yeah.
Inhale the smoke and hold it.	What is this, like freebase?
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?	I feel good.
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.	She ain't in on it.
Are you getting this on tape?	I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?	Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
David --	We're playing!
Yes.	I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.	There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --	Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.	You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.	Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.	That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.	They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.	She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.	The police won't find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.	Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Madrigal's alive.	What?
What's your name?	Javier Rodriguez.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?	It's possible.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.	Any idea how much?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?	I have money --
I got money.	I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
Oh, man --	She hasn't called you?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --	We sometimes went downtown to score.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.	You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?	Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
Who are these guys?	Agents who died in the field.
Who do we interface with on their side?	What do you mean?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.	Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Did you tell him?	No. On you go.
I'm sorry.	Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?	Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --	You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.	Can you not go yourself.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.	Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Buy yourself that island in the sun?	For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Where's that?	It's where I live.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?	Eh-
Sorry.	Shut up.
Come on.	No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
I don't see why not.	Because it's illegal.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.	Easy for you to say.
What do you want?	Are you clean?
You're too young.	Too young for what?
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.	Unless you get caught.
So, what's he like?	Well, he's young and he's healthy.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.	What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?	It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.	Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
I'm an old boy myself, you know?	Oh, really?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.	Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?	You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
There's no need.	It's no problem.
Thanks, Mark.	No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Exactly.	Nightmare.
Director?	Lewis Gilbert.
Who wrote it?	But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Yeah.	That's your theory?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.	It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
God, you're sick.	And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?	Fuck you.
Why would I want to sell my passport?	It was just an idea.
What?	There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
What was your price?	Four Grand.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.	Well, it's up to you.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.	He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
No, I don't think so.	To see you through the night that lies ahead.
What's on the menu this evening?	Your favourite dish.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?	Stick it on my tab.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.	As you wish.
Sounds great, Swanney.	Yeah.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.	Such as?
Six weeks and no sex?	I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
A walk.	But where?
Homeless people?	No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Qual se tu?	It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.	And how did you breach the Barrier?
He has his doubts...	You doubt me?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.	Is there a problem, gentlemen?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.	Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Can we have it quiet?	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...	With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Where did you get this power?	The power was within you.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?	Join my quest.
What is it you seek?	What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?	I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.	Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.	Put it on the screen.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.	Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.	Go, Sulu.
Goodnight, Spock.	Goodnight, Doctor.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?	I cannot be certain.
I do not often think of the past.	Who is it he reminds you of?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.	Fascinating.
Spock.	Yes, Captain?
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!	Captain, what have I done -
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!	If you think it would help.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.	If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.	Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?	I have a half brother.
How do you know?	The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...	"c."... "k."
...mark two.	Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
What is this?	I believe we are witnessing my birth.
We must change our course at once.	I'll take you to the bridge.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?	I'm afraid of nothing.
No... I didn't.	Now learn something about yourself.
You are mad!	Am I? We'll see.
	
	
	
Borgus Frat.	"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.	Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.	It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I know you better than that.	Do you?
Sybok, we must find a way...	No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
I don't get it.	You haven't told him?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.	I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Dillinger?	Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...	Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?	Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Flynn had Group 7 access.	Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
I want to go to his place.	You call that getting over it?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.	I'm certainly not.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.	Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Come on in...	Alan. Alan Bailey.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.	oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
You said it.	So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.	Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
That was uncalled-for.	I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Yes?	I... have come to communicate with my User.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.	Hah.
Flynn!!	Greetings, program...
Hey... you guys OK?	How about you?
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?	Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.	We have to talk.
A User?	That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...	Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
But-what if I can't...?	You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.	We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
You think we can make it there?	We have to.
Do you know what he's talking about?	I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Yori... hey...	Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
What is it?	Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.	I'm shocked.
Can you cover me for an hour?	Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you going?	Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
You seem fine now.	Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Dana, are you listening to me?	Yeah, Dad.
How was school today?	Fine.
Dad, how come you know the words?	Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.	Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.	You're kidding.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.	Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
Copy that.	And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Abu Kaleem Malik.	Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.	You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.	I'll just hang then, shall I?
Nobody believes it can happen to them.	It can't be.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?	I still don't believe it.
Is this national security stuff boring you?	Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.	Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.	Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Now what?	There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
I thought this look like your work.	Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--	... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
He's got it.	Sorry.
My husband is a good man.	But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.	Yes, sir.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?	That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.	Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?	Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
What did you tell him?	I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.	I'll handle it.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--	It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.	I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Not because you were attracted to him?	No.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.	Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?	No.
My husband can't know about this.	No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I can do it!	The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?	What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
What did he give you?	Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
I don't take those assignments.	What about Juno?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.	What?
As much as you used to?	No.  Much more.
Oh shit.	Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.	So what's your angle?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.	What about the husbands?
What does she do?	Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?	Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Yeeaoowww!!	You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Boris and Doris?	Go ahead.
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.	No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
What's going on, Harry?	Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.	Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.	It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.	I just glances inside.
What do you want me to do?	Find out who this Renquist it.
Gotten your mail yet?	Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?	Knock wood.
The letter I sent.	The letter he sent.
Has he looked through it yet?	Ya looked through it?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?	Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.	It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.	Is that your real name? Really?
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.	I took a cab.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.	What time is it?
Tell me about yourself.	There's nothing to tell.
Ask me them again. One by one.	What do you do?
Burt Reynolds.	Would you like a bite of my pie?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?	Five.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.	You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?	Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?	What?
Yes.	You will?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.	What?
Is this a joke?	No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
I think what you did...	What?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.	That rhymes.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.	Heard that.
Naw naw!	You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Live with what?	With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Yeah.	Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.	I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?	Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
What?	Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -	Ask him if he got the letter.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.	You goin' out?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!	I certainly hope so.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?	It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What'd'ya tell 'em?	Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot what?	Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.	The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.	Two guys.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.	Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.	Yeah, let's just get outta here.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.	I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.	Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.	He trusts you?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.	Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Elliot.	Yeah?
No. Not yet.	You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.	I can see what you mean.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.	Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?	I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.	Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?	Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -	Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.	That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.	I got some money I can give you -
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?	Sure.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?	McTeague.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?	I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.	Step inside.
Could we try it now?	Absolutely.
That Vietnam movie?	Uh-huh.
Do you believe him?	I believe he believes him.
He'll wear a wire?	We talked him into it.
But a fuckin' baggie.	No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -	But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Suspect's words -	To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He knows.	How the fuck could he know?
We gotta get him outta there.	Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.	This guy's gonna kill him.
Preach on, Big D.	Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!	Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.	No way, JosÈ.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?	Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Well?	Uh, what?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.	For a man in your position...an opportunity.
We're very close!  Because of you!	This is it, James...what you've been working for.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.	Shut up!
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.	Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?	It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.	So that...???
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?	I need to go now.
July.	July?!
What year do you think it is?	1995?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.	Perhaps it was a wrong number...
It's just a shot to calm you.	No more drugs.  Please...
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?	Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.	And I was in it?  What did I do?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?	Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Mason???	Jeffrey Mason?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?	You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
What made you think that?	Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.	James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
You... you couldn't have heard me.	They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.	If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?	No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?	Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.	What's that mean?
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.	You do know me.  You helped me once.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!	How did you find me?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.	The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?	You're insane, Jeffrey.
Nine thirty	Might be tight.
What?  What did you say?	Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?	I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.	That's 'cause he's dead.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Maybe I do.	Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
I think I've heard that before.	What do you want for free?
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.	Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.	Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.	Will be.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.	It will.
But, in particular?	I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.	How much.
One way, or round trip?	One way.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.	I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
You want somethin'?	You Harlin?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?	'Cause Harlin used to own it.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--	Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.	I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?	If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
What time is it now?	Twenty-after-ten.
Nothing.	Don't look like nothing.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?	That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.	Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.	That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No!	What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!	There you go, sweet talking me again.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.	It is morning.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.	Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
What was that all about?	You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.	They look nice.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car.
Jesus.	You sure you can manage?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.	Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
You've been around.	I guess I've got wander in my blood.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.	If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What do you do anyway?	A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Did you ever?	Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.	From?
Lied?  What do you mean?	I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.	If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
Shit!	It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?	Because I know you're full of shit.
Where's the safe?	I don't know.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?	I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.	Yeah.  Good thinking.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.	Funny thing.
John . . .?	Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
He was going to take the money.	Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.	But I want to say with you,
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.	I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
John!	Grace!
It's . . . it's locked.	You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.	Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.
You've got to be--	Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Live there?	Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.	How do you know if you've never tried?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?	Just ran into a little trouble.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?	No.
Hungry?	No.
Now what can I do for you?	I was hoping we could talk.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.	That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.	This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
And for that you'd kill Grace?	For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.	I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.	And tell her what?
You know what I mean.	I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Shut up.	Came close this time and it scares you.
You think that's a lot of money?	All I have in the world.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.	There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
I came to kill her.	Liar.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.	Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.	What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
What are you babbling about?	Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?	What?
Got any requests?	That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?	Oz.
But you was going to fight for me.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.	Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.	What the hell are you talking about?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.	Will you shut up!
You're fucked.	You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
They're not very imaginative?	'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!	Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.	I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.	You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?	I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
The old lady?	With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Do you understand me you little fuck?	Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.	Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!	Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Got any cold soda?	Eh?
No police.	But, Senor--
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?	You want something?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.	You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?	I'm sorry, I didn't--
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?	I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?	All right, old man.  Christ.
Oh, Jesus.	I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?	He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?	So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.	So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Mister!	Oh, shit!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.	I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?	Who the hell are you?
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!	You broke my nose!
I'm a solid man.	Bobby Cooper.
Hey!	That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.	Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.	How do you know if you've never tried?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.	I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.	Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.	Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.	A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
You meant it.	What makes you say that?
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.	And what does that make you?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.	You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Next time you'll do just fine.	No!
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.	Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?	What are you talking about!
Two-hundred dollars?	Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.	You're too quick for me.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?	Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?	Yeah, I can fix it.
Accident.	You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...	Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Nothing.	Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.	Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?	About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.	Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.	You believe that?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.	You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.	What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Got any cold soda?	Eh?
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.	No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.	Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Where you headed?	I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?	Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.	Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Where'd you learn to do that?	From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.	Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You love him?	No.
Did you ever?	Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I'm guessing no.	Yeah, I guess you're right.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.	I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
I don't know how.	Walk away.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.	If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Grace ... Grace?	After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.	He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?	Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Hope is a four-letter word.	But we all need that too. Hold him.
Morning, officer.	Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Where ya goin'?	Harlin's.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.	And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.	How much?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.	The ticket is 30.55.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!	Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
I axed you a question.	Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Proceed.	Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Is that the entire message?	Yes.
How old is Jeb?	Four.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.	I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Is Jeremy okay?	He's asleep.
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
...I can't remember.	That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.	No that's it.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?	My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.	Jesus.
I'm not sure.	Think carefully?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?	Seventy-five percent.
What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.
Just give me a minute.	Is there a problem?
He's kind of a miracle.	Yes he is.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?	I want to sleep here tonight.
I think it's be better if I was alone.	I won't make any noise.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.	How much can you lift?
I'm not scared.	That's great.
Don't be scared.	Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?	Fine.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.	How long have you been married?
You and my mother would have a special connection.	Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Well, go get it then.	Where is it?
I didn't think they'd really do it.	What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?	Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
He tell you where them others is?	Nope.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?	You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Oh. How long I been here?	Three days. Are you hungry?
Are you really going to kill them?	Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.	Shit and fried eggs.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.	I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.	No?
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.	You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Heard you done the roof yourself.	Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?	Yup.
All week?	I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
They really got all that money, them whores?	You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Like I said, I...	What's your name?
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.	"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
Duke.	Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...	He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.	Is... is it... loaded?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."	Did you... kill him?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.	Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What?	Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
He's... he's dead.	No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...	Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?	N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?	About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
What'd Ned say?	L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Schofield? You from Schofield?	On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.	Well, how about it?
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...	Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...	I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?	Lookin' at?
Finish him, Ned.	He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Better re-load it.	You missed him? You didn't...?
I... I... think I'm... shot.	You ain't shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?	Huh?
How long you gonna be, Bill?	Two weeks, I guess.
Shit.	How far kin you see?
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.	Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
No.	What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.	You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.	We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Fuck you.	He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?	Yeah.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.	How many you killed, Kid?
I don't kill nobody without him. 	We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
He's gonna die, ain't he?	Maybe.
Well, suppose he does?	We'll bury him.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.	Yeah?
I don't get it.	They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Who ?	Bear with me here...
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +	And ?
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.	&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
Don't give up on me now, Dean.	They'll never stop.
Come home, Dean.	Alright.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.	This whole thing was a shakedown.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.	Then who goes?
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.	The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
Why don't you just calm down'	What do you care what he says?
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?	I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
How do you do?	Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.	McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
I was out of line.	You okay?
I'11 be alright.	Well, I'm sorry.
No killing?	Not if we do it my way.
What is it Keaton?	Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What is this?	Who's Keyser Soze?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.	Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.	You're lying.
What do you mean I can't see him?	The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
He won't go into the interrogation room.	Someplace else, then.
No, no, no, no, no.	If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.	I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.	I told the D.A. everything I know.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.	Keaton was a piece of shit.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.	What lawyer?
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?	Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.	This is totally irrelevant.
You're stalling, Verbal.	Give a guy a break, huh?
Then what?	McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?	Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.	But Keaton...
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?	Because he was my friend.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.	THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.	The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.	Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
What did he find?	Nothing.
He was accused of jury tampering.	Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...	... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?	... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
Say it.	I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...	...I was one of a group of...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...	Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?	Just as you are, Sir...
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?	Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Mr. Concannon...?	Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.	You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.	...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...	Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?	I...
That's not my handwriting.	You've just said you signed it.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?	After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?	Hold on a second.
I am on the staff of...	Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.	The Doctors were not negligent.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...	From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?	Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?	It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
And you wrote that...	Yes.
Yes.	You're going to settle out of court?
Yes.	Why?
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...	Her doctors killed her.
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...	I understand.
Who are you protecting, then?	Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.	Why is that?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...	I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I had a witness disappear on me.	That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.	I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.	Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.	What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?	If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Listen to me, fella...	No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Mr. Galvin's...	Let me talk to Mickey.
Pardon?	Kathy Price.
Really.  How wonderful for you.	Yes.  It was, actually.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.	And are they going to get it?
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.	Who told you that?
Maybe I'll tell you later.	Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...	If I don't 'grow up...'
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..	He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
Admittance form is wrong.	Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...	...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.	Right.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.	Right.
So what?	So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.	So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
That's right.	I think we tried that.  The case is over.
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.	All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...four years ago...	Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
... I'm sure you do ...	But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I understand ...	My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...	We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
I just saw her.	In New York?
Thank you.	You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?	Mrs...
Kathy Price...	Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...	Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?	Yes.
What did she say?	She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...	Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...	Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...	We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?	Yes.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?	I married into it.
I didn't mean to be that rough.	No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.	That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.	There are things you didn't tell me.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.	Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Hello.	Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --	Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --	0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
What do you want to know?	Your name. And --
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...	No, you don't owe me anything.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --	No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?	No, Ernie's is fine.
Where are you going?	To complete my cure.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.	No! Let me go!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!	Your accident...
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?	I don't know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?	I loved you, Madeleine.
Do you remember where you were?	Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.	Where had you been before?
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.	John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.	No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
One shouldn't live alone.	Some people prefer it.
Oh! Yes. Hello.	Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.	You've nothing to apologize for.
-- talking to you...	I enjoyed talking to you.
I hope we will, too.	What?
Good-bye.	Good-bye.
Do you know where you're going?	Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.	I don't like them.
Why?	Knowing I have to die...
Do you hear anything?	Only silence. It's always like this.
Where are you now?	Here with you.
Why did you jump?	No!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.	And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
What else?	A grave...
Where?	I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...	And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!	I'm here, I've got you...
You've been there before. You've seen it.	No, never!
Here with you.	And it's a all real.
Madeleine --	Please let me go.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.	I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church alone.	Why?
Oh, yes!	Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
What do you mean?	What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I know. Everybody tells me.	Johnny, the doctors explained --
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?	It's where you belong.
Well?... what'll you do?	Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.	I've never run across one like that.
Pop Leibel.	Who?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?	Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?	Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.	All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
Out!	And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Midge!	Bye-bye!
Around.	Oh?
What was this desperate urge to see me?	All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?	Oh... this and that.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.	Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...	What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
She died.	How?
The stripper's here.	Excellent.
She's fucking hot!	I need a drink.
Can't do what?	We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
How ya doing?	What?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.	First of all...
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.	Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...	Franco mother-fucking Harris!
The floor was wet. She slipped!	Why was the floor wet?
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.	Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
More.	Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?	Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.	You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Don't talk to me about character.	Watch the tone fella.
Fuck you Boyd!	Any time fat boy!
Who? What are you talking about?	They're on me. They're smoking me out!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.	It has worked.
They're screaming for Starbursts.	Later.
We'll be ready Adam.	I know you'll be.  Three hours.
I won't do it.	Don't eyeball your kids.
Have you thought about what I said?	Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?	Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Who?	The groom?
She's in there!	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
We need padded chairs.	Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!	Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.	You always were a jealous man.
Boyd...What have we done?	What did you ask me?
Regarding what?	Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?	Yeah.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.	Now?
My what?	You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Okay fine.	Fine? Fine what?
The hell I did!	You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Your ideas never work out.	Oh really? Starbucks?
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.	And what happens when you can't?
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?	Israel doesn't have a King.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.	What's your point?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?	The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.	They need leadership.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.	You said nobody would miss her.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!	You will not screw this up.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!	Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Why can't we do it through the mail?	We missed the deadline.
The wedding cake check?	Sent it.
Stop it. I'm sorry.	You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Are we going to do this again?	I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.	It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.	David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...	Who else?
That's absurd.	I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.	I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Not padded ones.	So what do we do?
You go down there.	Go down where?
Take care of those chairs.	We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Will you please call the chair people?	I will.
Hello.	Hi.
What about the chairs?	Okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?	No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
What's the word on the chairs?	I'm working on it.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?	Yeah. You.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.	No it's not okay. It's not.
What kind of stupid question is that?	Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What are you talking about?	Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Who's dead?	The prostitute.
Call the police.	It's too late.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?	She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.	The only proof is those bodies.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.	You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.	I just want her to be happy.
I'm not breathing right.	You're not breathing right?
Where did you get that?	At the newsstand on 3rd.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".	The wahoo?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.	No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
No...No.	How do you know she's dead.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.	Did she believe you?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.	Yup.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.	What song?
Fucking desert.	Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
Shut up Micheal.	I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.	Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Enedina and Paco ...	What about them?
Which couch?	That one.
Take me there.	Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?	To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.	In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.	You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...	Evil.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.	Today I can refuse you nothing.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.	You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?	I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.	Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.	It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.	Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.	Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
So, Ramona!	Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
How in hell does it wind up?	I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Me, rich? Come on!	There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.	Where's the dough?
He was very good. Better than some people would think.	Why did he kill himself?
I don't know -- they've always been there.	That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.	I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Are your parents alive?	Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Yes -- very, very big!	He couldn't get through the door, then?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.	Yes!
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.	I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?	Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why would they be going there?	I don't know.
You all right?	Why'd.. .you pull me out?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.	Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.	Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?	If you can catch him.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.	You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.	I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?	We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
What's the assignment?	You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.	I was assured the problem was corrected.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.	Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.	This is supposed to be years away.
How should I know?	Show me his physical sensory level.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.	Then fix it.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!	True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?	It was me, what?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.	What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.	I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
You all right?	Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.	Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.	Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.	Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.	How did you get your hand out?
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?	I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
She's beautiful, you know?	Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?	I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Relax. I know what you meant.	I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?	Enjoying yourself?
What's the problem?	I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.	Start of what?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.	You like baseball?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?	I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Nice work.	Thanks.
Find out anything?	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
That's why I'm asking.	Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Where's John?	Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
There you go —— best seat in the house.	You are going after Mayor Bennett.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.	As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Do they have to look so...robotic?	At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
What if he's busy tonight?	<u>Lure</u> him. 
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 	Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?	I don't think you're gonna need it.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.	I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...	All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Mr. President, this is St...	Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?	...twelve years.
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...	You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.	Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?	...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.	What rig?
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...	Okay.  And she's alleging...?
What would do that...?	What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.	I'll see you at National.
...the... 	The American "people"?
Why?	Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:	Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Yes.	Why?
...where is the Back End coming from?	It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.	Eight Days To Go 
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.	Anything at the Airport?
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...	...this's <u>good</u>...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...	Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?	<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...	I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
War's over, Pal. 	Gloria -- sell the House.  
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?	Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...	Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
...where is my pill?	ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.	How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
We're due at Andrews. 	Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
S'only got to hold for another few days.	Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Dartmouth	Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
China.	When's he coming back...?
How much...?	And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Do I know you?	We have some mutual friends in Washington.
What do you think would hold it off?	Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?	Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 	Why Albania?
Who?	The... 
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.	Is that true?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?	...going to War...
"The Country Is At War." 	It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
They got to have something that we want.	I'm sure they do.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.	...it's a Teaser!
You can't have a war without an enemy.	No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
What is it?	President's speech.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...	No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
What?	The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?	...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Yeah...?	"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.	Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
I think it's fine?	It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.	In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Where is he now?	Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
What's the thing with Morse Code...	Oh, you're gonna love this:
My prop guy, had a guy out here.	Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
Mmm...	You do your job right, nobody should notice.

His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...	...we'll gettim in their cars.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...	Ain't <u>that</u> the truth.

He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?	Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
You can't tell this story.	Why not?

It's tough to rhyme.	I believe in you....

...mmm.	...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Yup.	How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.	They don't know what's going on!
Grand Marnier.	Sounds like a french word, what is it?
... That's what you told us to say.	Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?	...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.	...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
What the hell...	Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Hey the door was open.	Then get out and close it behind you.
Sell?	Now! Tell everyone to dump!
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,	Coulda been a contender.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.	Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.	Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?	Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.	...Work okay?
What brings you out here...	Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.	... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...	I met them before you were born.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.	Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
What if he asks where I got the money?	Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.	We are?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?	Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.	I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
So what firm you with, pal?	Jackson, Steinem...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?	Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...	There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
My home number's on the back...	Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...	...I can't even see it...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.	...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.	What? How do you know about my father?
Know the name?	'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...	I don't understand.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.	...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.	But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!	I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.	Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
What the hell do you want?	I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Hello Bud.	Gordon.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.	Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.	I gather you're a decorator.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.	And what do you want?
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?	Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
How you doing Buddy?	Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Bud! Where you been the last two days?	...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.	No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.	It's over you, Gordon.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.	Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!	You got it, G.G.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!	We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
He still likes you	Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
He did?	Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
What's that?	A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Anybody want another drink?	It's eleven forty-five let's go
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.	Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Your books Master Loftmore	Thank you Jenkins
She went to a waxwork party	A party at a waxwork huh?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.	I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.	That's not what you said last night.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.	Who's is all this?
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night	Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
No thank you sir we're fine.	So Mark, what's so urgent?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either	Sell my soul?
Of course you will.	I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
He loves you very much.  He just--	I know he does.
Pretty.  She's a blond.	Do you have any idea who she is?
Are you humoring me?	Nope.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?	I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...	You were in an accident?
How're you holding up?	Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.	Almost.
I'm sorry?	I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Toward the end.  You remember?	Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Oh-kay...	I have to go.
That's not...It's not like that.	I've never even met you.
Love.	What?
Why are you here?	I don't know.
They're calling me in to work.	I should be going anyway.
Wow.	This is...
He looked like one of the Monkees.	Anyway, Claire slept with him...
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.	She's making this up.
Oh my god.  You bought it.	Yep.
Absolutely.	Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Telling you...	...no...no...no...
Place your fingers on the planchette.	The planchette?
Something was there.  You saw it.	Did I?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.	No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Adamant?	Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?	What are you going to do?
Jody, she tried to kill him.	I know.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.	Don't.
It's today?	Yep.
Whatcha reading?	Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.	We did.
Tired?	Nope.
Maybe we should just...	Tomorrow.
Why?	To make sure she's all right.
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.	But what if something happens?
What are you doing here?	There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Think I may have cracked it.	Really?
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."	Well, that's nice.
He killed her.	What?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.	And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
When?	What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
What are you doing?	Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I never said...	...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Who did?	Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Sabotage?	Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...	Claire, please...
You dropped a glass.	I...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.	But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...	Stop...
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
I think she's starting to suspect something.	Who?
I never asked you to quit!	...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...	How did she know where it was?
Look for antiques...	Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Adamant.	What?
:Would you stop it!	:Well, they are.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!	But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.	Come.  There is a lot to read
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.	Then you wear it.
I beg your par---	When did she die...?
My...mother...?	Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -	I under5tand.  All the same
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.	Better than most, I suppose.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.	It wes a dream...!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -	You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Do what you can.	Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Lasher - bring us through!	Now, lasher - it is our time.
Parents say he - uh - fell -	Anybody got a BP yet...?
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -	FAST.
STOP!	Always loved you..
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---	I bring her flowers too.
If that were true, I would not be here.	It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.	What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
But I could understand. I want to understand!	I LOVE him!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..	Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Only you...	Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
What is wrong...?	Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
No!	Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?	It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.	No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.	'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -	You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
HARDER!	Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...	You still feel that crazy...?
I'm serious.  You don't -	Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Rowan...?	Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Everyone - this is Michael curry.	Hello..
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 	Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.	Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.	Go ahead.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.	Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Wow...	If you like that type.
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.	Just don't fall off any ladders.
Rowan Mayfair.	Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?	You really love this guy...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.	Is that a crack about our singing...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.	Papers...?
Which do you think is her best shot...	The one on the left - definitely...
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN	Yes it is...
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?	Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
And it can't be forged?	I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job	No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
This must be one of the old keys -	Yes - I have had it for years.
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?	Sure...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of	my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
What did you do with her?	You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
How long have you been watching me?	I have something I have to show you...
then why did you marry her -	It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league	I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?	Did you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.	STEPHANIE?
What?	I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Yes...	You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...	But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot	No thanks - 
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar	Why whats wrong with the sugar -
What's wrong with you?	I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!	Yes I can...
Is LESLIE here?	No he had to - he's just - he's out...
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?	Get out...
That's good	I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.	Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!	Cut it out, before you break something!
You kiss your mother with that mouth?	I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.	Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
You'll never believe who's in there.	It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?	We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."	This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Never say never.	Oh, god.  Look. Look.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.	These are real, live women?
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.	He kicked major ass and you know it.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?	From your lips, to God's ears.
Well. The prom's coming up.	Yeah?
And I was wondering.	Yeah?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?	SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.	So you'll think about it?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!	So that's a maybe?
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.	I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.	Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
God, you are so hot.	Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.	We own a small family grocery store.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.	We miss you. We miss our son.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.	Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.	Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Son.	Well, why should I?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.	Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.	I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.	Just say it, Dad.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.	Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?	Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.	Hi ho, Silver.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.	I always knew there was more. I felt it.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?	Whatever you want.
Ted! Do something!	What do you want me to do?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.	I understand.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.	But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."	I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?	She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.	You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You're a peach.	Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.	I didn't forget.
Great.	From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.	But you triple-dog-dared me.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?	Your article sucked.
In what sense?	In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.	That's not ENTIRELY true.
I don't get the distinction.	Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.	I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
She said peanuts, you cretin.	You never know around here.
Funny you should say "peachy."	I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.	I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Why can't you be nice to me?	You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Wow...you clean up nice.	Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.	Eventually you'll let go.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.	But you never do.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.	Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
That has more to do with your proximity to me.	My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.	Wearing them?  Or humping them?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.	That's refreshingly deviant.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."	You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.	Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.	Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Well? Surprised?	What is all this? When are you coming home?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?	Only the best for my mother.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?	Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.	Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.	Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.	Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.	Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
I'm warning you.	A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?	As much as possible.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?	Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.	Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I do?	You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.	Me? The King of Coitus?
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."	You think we should be more open minded?
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.	In other words, our scope is too narrow.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.	Really? So I'm doing OK?
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?	Seriously? I'm doing all right?
Yes?	We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.	All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.	Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
How quaint.	It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...	That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?	Kelly.
She's going to wash your Jeep?	Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...	What about the blood?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.	And the child...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.	I understand.
Then what?	He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
How long?	She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Maybe she used another name.	Ray thinks she was murdered.
I've got that two o'clock in town.	Back to the land of grownups.
It's our job, Gloria.	Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.	Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?	The skinny brunette.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.	Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.	What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...	Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?	You have someplace to be?
If you want company...	Just check out the car.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.	Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.	We don't know that, Ray...
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.	Where's Lombardo?
About a year ago.	He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.	So you were alone.
I want a full-scale investigation.	You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...	The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...	I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.	You didn't cuff her?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.	I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Ms. Toller?	I said he did.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?	No!
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...	Yeah, but...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.	Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?	What brain?
Is that Sam Lombardo?	Hi, Mon.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?	Whichever one I want.
Kelly.  What is it?	I miss Dad.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.	Where, the mall?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.	Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?	Why can't you come...
I'm running away.	You think that's wise?
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...	That's cop bullshit.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.	About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.	Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.	I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...	Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Yes.	But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?	It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?	The bitch shot me, is what happened.
You mean this thing?	Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
But I..	Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, right.	Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...	But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Why don't you come in, have a drink?	Can't.  Got a passenger.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.	What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.	Goodbye, Sandra.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.	You need that real often?
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.	Is this leading somewhere?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.	Prepare what?
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.	Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All that jumping and kicking.	That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.	At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Jim, are you all right?	No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Well... that, too.	Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
So... what happened?	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
You might have mentioned you had that.	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
No record of him.	You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
What's this?	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?	You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
When we find him, he is mine.	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.	What?  President Grant is...!
I know!  I know!	I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.	I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Are those just button buttons or...?	Of course not.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.	What is this?  A whole new train?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.	Well, I owe you one, don't I?
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?	You tell me.
You've... done... this... before.	I've had some practice.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.	Fine, I'll stop.
Look, I'm Captain James West...	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...	A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.	That'll be all, boys.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?	On my way to Denver...
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.	Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!	Dr. Loveless?
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.	That would be... the Mexican War?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.	A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
This is something.	It's a smelting retort.
I beg your pardon?	You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Well?	They're coming.
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...	Right.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.	He thought you were a woman, Airk!
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?	She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
You are very important, Willow.	No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
They look like acorns.	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?	No.  I mean yes.
I can't.	Let me see it.
I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.
Because it's true.	I don't believe you.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.	Good.  How long will it take?
Thanks for your help, Peck.	Are you okay?
You all right?	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?	I hate this.
You gotta promise to feed her.	I will.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.	Of course!  I promise!
You!!	Where the hell did you come from?
Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.
She's in love.	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Watch it!	Ahhh!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.	Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
I don't know, Willow.	Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Can't we keep it, Dada?	Absolutely not.
Dada, what's a daikini?	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Who are you!  Who are you!	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?	I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!	Why?
I'm not going in there.	Me neither!
We gotta follow them.	Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.	Shut up.
I'm getting her out of there!	No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Hey, careful there!	How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Obviously.	Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?	Guess I'm not used to so much.
Your hole is healed, then?	Pretty much.
Everything is all right, John.	Pick up the hat.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?	No pistol. Ever.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.	You don't say.
Hey, Sam...	...I want to say a thing.
Don't let them hurt you.	I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
What have you got?	Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.	The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.	Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
What's your first move?	A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Who else knows?	Just us.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.	Don't try me, Johnny!
You have no right to keep us here.	Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
What was that?	He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Now what's the problem?	The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Oh? Anything else?	Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Who are they?	The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.	But you can't.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.	Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Enjoying your reading?	Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
What else can you do?	I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Sure.	But... You may not be well enough.
You're so sure of that?	Aren't you? After today?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!	Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
I want you to take this... to remember by.	Where's my baggy pants?
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.	Johnny, what the fuck?
I'm coming.	Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.	Say again?
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...	What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
What's so funny?	Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?	I have committed no sin.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?	Yes. Samuel! We're going.
Get back in there.	My son is out there!
Aunt Em!	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Dorothy!	You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --	Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Yes.	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Uhh -- yeah --	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --	Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally	But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!	If any!
Our echo.	Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Uhhhh -- yes...	I don't believe you!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!	Oh ....
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!	Ohhh!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.	This?
Who did it? Now wait a minute.	Hickory!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
I thought you said she was dead.	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!	The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Oh, now?	Whenever you wish.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Oh --	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Where do you want to be oiled first?	My mouth -- my mouth!
Oh --	...Oh, did that hurt?
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.	Well, you're perfect now.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
We might.	Oh --
Oh, he's just ascared again.	Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!
Yes -- let's run!	Yes.
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.	And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?	Not nobody, not nohow!
How about a hippopotamus?	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Does it work?	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!	Did they hurtcha?
Oh, now I'll never get home!	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
...yes.	Ohhhh --
...free!	Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
I don't blame you for that.	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
No -- No -- No -- No!	Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!	Leave her alone!
Come on -- I've got another idea.	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Dorothy!	Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Not even a rhinoceros?	Imposserous!
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.	Yeah --
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.	I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't get around us that easy!	Not nohow!
... about Dorothy.	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
That's right.	We do.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --	A heart --
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!	It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!	I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!	Now, now, don't fret.
Yeah --	I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!	Go on!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?	Well, I --
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.	Th.D.?
-- Ruined my exit!	Help!
What happened to Len Tashka?	Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.	So who are you?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!	I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Nuclear.	Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Is there another way?	We go down to the torpedo bay.
He’s sealed himself in.	He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.	But what if...
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.	I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
He survived?	The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.	He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.	The worm on the hook again.
Your last chance. Take the money.	Your last chance. Give me the name.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.	Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
She’ll get over it.	You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.	Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
Does this look familiar to you?	It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?	It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.	You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I can’t stay.	I know.
Vodka martini.	Two. Shaken not stirred.
What the hell are you doing here?	Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.	You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.	Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.	You turned Renard.
One... last... screw?	Oh James.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?	She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Now...where were we?	A rope!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?	This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Mother of God.	The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.	What class sub does your nephew run?
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.	Someone will come.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?	Yes.  Au revoir...
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.	And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?	Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Any word from him?	Still no contact yet.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.	Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
No idea who's behind this?	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Walter --	Don't call me that.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?	Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --	Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Blake?  Dead?	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Jon --	Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?	Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --	No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
-- What is it.	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.	Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.	What are you up to?
They're practically on us . . .	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
What?	The costumes.  Am I right?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.	That's because --
Welcome back, Night Owl.	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
What new information?	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .	Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
What happened?	The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?	Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?	He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!	Isn't it true that you --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.	That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.	Am I free to go?
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.	Jon??  You mean he's --
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --	Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.	No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
What is this place?	Looks like a diner.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.	Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.	You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
What do I get out of it?	If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.	Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.	If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?	Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.	I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.	You're a jerk-off, you know that?
What do you have?	Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.	They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
Whatchu doing here?	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.	You wanna check it out? Come here.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.	Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?	Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
I don't know what you're talking about.	The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?	Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.	So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.	If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?	I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
What are you doing with the Ivans?	I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?	It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Yorgi and Kirill.	Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.	I thought that was in detail.
I can see that. Why?	You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?	You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.	Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
What...?	I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.	Here we go again.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.	Yeah, thanks a lot.
Sorry, "dude".	What's the deal?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?	Why you dogging me up?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?	A parachute. This does not argue well.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?	He's a pretty good actor, though.
Help me with this guy.	It's like you said, every man for himself.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?	Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.	It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Very nice. I'm impressed.	I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
I had to inspect the merchandise first.	Of course.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.	You wanna see my politics?
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."	"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.	You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.	That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
That was for Anders.	Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.	You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.	Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --	Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
What does that mean?	The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
I wish I could go.	We all do.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?	I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.	For what purpose?
What's wrong with him?	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.	Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.	What's that?
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.	Into the Hudson?
Anything else I can get you?	Some cigars.  Case of beer.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.	Were you now?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --	Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
The point of what?	This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
Now that's Magneto talking.	No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
You designed this yourself?	Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
He helped you?	We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
Don't you knock?	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...	What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?	The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
I lost him.	How?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.	Not at the cost of lives, Max.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?	What do you want with him?
And who might you be?	Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?	Poppycock!
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?	Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.	Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.	What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
What?	Baack!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?	MMMmmmm.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.	MMmmm.
And your passport?	Yes, don't worry.
Will you miss me?	Very....very!
I will!  Goodbye, darling!	Goodbye, darling.
Ready, darling?	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?	You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
I suppose you're right.	Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.	This is the only library I know of.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?	I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Well... we'll see.	Will there be anything else?
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?	This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
How long will this whole thing take?	A week.  Ten days at most.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!	But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?	How old are you, young man?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.	I'm sure we will.
Did you hear that strange music??	What?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?	What?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!	'How I Did It.'  Good title!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.	Tonight?
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.	Don't fall for that one.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.	You can say that again.
Yes.	You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
How's it going?	What did you find out?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!	Can you play it?
What monster?	What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...	I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?	MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!	Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.	...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
May I see your violin?	It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Are you busy?	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?	Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Look, Doctor!	Well, this explains the music.
Oh, Doctor!	I think you've done it, master.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'	Stop -- singing!!!
Good night, Doctor.	Good night!
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?	Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?	Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
	Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Drink!	Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!	Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .	Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?	One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Why don 't the Zulus attack?	Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
An historical moment, Gentlemen.	Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.	Thank you.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?	Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
